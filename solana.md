Evaluation of Solana: A Moment in (Proof of) History
Ethereum killers are abundant in the crypto industry but none of them have been successful in providing more value and becoming a prominent competitor of Ethereum.
Solana, on the other hand, has gained increasing traction over time and it is certainly more than just an Ethereum killer. If Ethereum was Samsung, Solana might be the Oneplus(BTW I have Oneplus that’s why I keep coming back to it).
PS If you are wondering who is Apple, that’s obvious(I have Apple too, the real one that you can eat, not the reference one sadly).
Solana is a more efficient alternative to Ethereum. The fast execution and ability to generate buzz, on the other hand, has caused its SOL token to skyrocket and blue-chip investors to rush in with $314 million of capital this summer.
How Solana has stood apart?
Solana’s key features:
1. Proof of History(PoH) consensus — lesser energy consumption, efficient, faster.
2. Tower BFT — PBFT with a twist to leverage the PoH consensus
3. Turbine — Better than the typical gossip protocol.
4. Gulf Stream — enables faster transaction validation, playing a major role in the high
throughput of Solana
5. Sealevel — Concurrency in Blockchain transactions, very powerful
6. Pipeline, Cloudbreak, Archivers — They would get awards for Supporting roles if there was a Blockchain Filmfare.
An application built on Solana Blockchain can leverage these characteristics to achieve unparalleled throughput, scalability, security, and finality.
Solana Blockchain can process 710,000 transactions per second on a standard gigabit network if the transactions are, on average, no more than 176 bytes.
Although Solana’s mainnet beta was only released in Feb 2020, it is still a relatively new project. Despite this, SOL, Solana’s native cryptocurrency, has already surged into the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Even though the mainnet is fully functional, it is officially still in beta, indicating that the team is still working on improving the network’s features and stability.
Recently, Solana mainnet beta faced issues due to an increase in the number of transactions. Due to a substantial increase in the number of transactions on the platform, primarily due to a new social networking site called grape, a huge backlog of transactions caused the network to crash.
While people started raising questions about Solana being centralized, one thing has been forgotten that it is still in a nascent stage. That’s what beta release is for.
The thing to consider here is that it achieved 400,000 transactions per second. THAT’S AMAZING.
