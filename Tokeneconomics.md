 Token Allocation/Distribution: how many tokens are reserved for the founding team, the investors/advisors, and the community/ecosystem? We’re 
 typically looking for at least 50% going to the community. Why? The community allocation is used to incentivize the formation of multi-sided marketplaces — driving network effects and network value.

- Lock Up and Vesting Periods: look for 1-year lock-ups and 3-4 years vesting schedules for the founders/core contributors, investors, and advisors. This gives us confidence that the core team and investors are in it for the long haul and cannot dump their coins on the market as soon as the token is listed publicly.

- Utility of the token: What is the value prop of the project and what is the token used for? For example, Ethereum is a layer 1 blockchain that allows for a marketplace of decentralized business/apps and new economic models to be built utilizing its base layer technology. If you want to access DeFi, buy/sell or mint an NFT, anchor data, build an app, play a game, send a transaction, etc you need some ETH. ETH, the native token, is the asset that powers the Ethereum ecosystem. This is why some refer to its utility as "digital oil."

- Staking or Incentives to Lock Up the Token: Is there a reason a user may want to lock up their tokens? This could include staking, which rewards users for locking up their tokens and providing services to the network (validating transactions). Look for valid reasons to stake — a service should be provided (such as validating transactions, providing liquidity, etc) rather than just locking up coins and being rewarded for doing so.



Unlimited Supply:

If it had an unlimited supply, it would eventually end up worth nothing, like Zimbabwe dollar (ZWL) which is currently being printed in 100trillion dollar 
bills. One ZWL = $ .0031 US It takes 320 ZWL to buy $1 USD right now. The US dollar has lost about 97% of its original value to-date. 
The more they print the less value each one has. The limited supply of crypto is what makes it so attractive.


**Token economics Types**
1, Deflationary model-
   Examples: Bitcoin (BTC), Cardano (ADA)

2, Inflationary model
                    An inflationary token will continuously be printed over time, with no capped limit of tokens that can ever be created. 
                    There are variations on the inflationary token model, with some tokens limiting token creation yearly, 
                    and others going based on a set schedule in perpetuity. 
                    Examples: Ethereum (ETH), EOS (EOS).
                    
3, Duel-token model
In the duel-token model, two distinct tokens are used on a single blockchain to create a better economic structure. Many projects in this model opt to have one token function as a store-of-value which generates a secondary, utility token to fuel actions on the blockchain network. This gives investors incentive to hold the store-of-value token as it generates returns in the form of the utility token.

Examples: VeChain (VET/VTHO), Ontology (ONT/ONG)

4, Asset-backed model
Some cryptocurrencies have chosen to back their tokens to another asset. In this asset-backed model, users can derive the value from the token based on the value of the token’s underlying assets. The most well-known (and highly controversial) asset-backed token is Tether, which purports to be backed by the US Dollar.

Example: Tether (USDT), Dai (DAI).

Utility vs Security: Once you have covered the basic information, it's time to go in-depth on the individual tokens. First check the purpose of the token. Utility tokens have a specific use case, such as acceed to a product or service on the blockchain. Security tokens are similar to stocks.

5. Token Supply: Analyse the total supply (number of tokens created - tokens being burned), maximum supply (total amount of tokens that will ever exist), circulating supply (tokens currently in supply), and market cap. The best indication of the token's economic value is the individual token price. Some projects issue tokens at a very cheap price (e.g. $0.00000001) to make investors think that the price can easily go 1000x. But the reality is if the marketcap of the token is already very large, it is probably unlikely for the token price to go very high (e.g. Shiba Inu).

6. Pre-mined tokens: Check if the tokens are pre-mined. Pre-mined means they have been created before the launch, very common in ICOs. Many layer 2 such as ERC20 tokens are pre-mined so that contributors, early investors, and contributors can be awarded. Pre-mined tokens often get distributed internally before they can be bought by the general public. If a significant amount of tokens is held by insiders at launch, then the token price can be easily manipulated by them.
