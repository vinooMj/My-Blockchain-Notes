Unlimited Supply:

If it had an unlimited supply, it would eventually end up worth nothing, like Zimbabwe dollar (ZWL) which is currently being printed in 100trillion dollar 
bills. One ZWL = $ .0031 US It takes 320 ZWL to buy $1 USD right now. The US dollar has lost about 97% of its original value to-date. 
The more they print the less value each one has. The limited supply of crypto is what makes it so attractive.
