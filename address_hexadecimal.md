What are those numbers and alphabets in Ethereum addresses?

Every Ethereum wallet address or smart contract address is written as :

0x followed by a combination of numbers and alphabets.

eg: 0x95a4cb58..... and so on.

But these are not just any alphabets.

The characters allowed are numbers 0-9 and alphabets a-f.

i.e. 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,a,b,c,d,e,f

This is actually 'hexadecimal' number system.

There are many number systems.

And every number system has a 'base'.

'Binary' number system has a base of 2. i.e. only two characters are allowed.

Hence it starts with 0, then 1.

And after that, no new character is allowed. So we move to 10 which is actually two.

11 is three, 100 is four.

In our common usage, we use the 'decimal' number system with a base of 10.

We have ten characters: 0-9 and then we move to 10 which is ten.

'Hexadecimal' number system has a base of 16. We have sixteen characters 0-9 and a-f which comprise numbers zero to fifteen.

f is the last single-character number i.e. fifteen.

After that, we have 10 which is sixteen.

The larger the base of a number system, the shorter the length of characters required to represent a number.

Example, twelve is represented as

1100 in binary,
12 in decimal and,
c in hexadecimal.
