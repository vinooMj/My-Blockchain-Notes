There are more than 266 apps and services on Cosmos.

Lets us understand how the Internet of Blockchain works

Cosmos is a network of blockchains that is built on top of tender mint consensus.

Tendermint has two main parts
-consensus engine
-application interface.

The consensus engine, which is based on the Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) meaning if there are few faulty nodes, will still perform the transaction correctly.

While on the other hand, the application interface allows developers to build custom DApps on top of the tender mint.

Cosmos is the hub while the multiple blockchains running on it are called zones which are connected through Interblock chain communication.

If Zone A has to send a transaction to Zone B within the cosmos ecosystem then the transaction is relayed to the Cosmos Hub through the IBC connection between the 
sender's zone 
and the Cosmos Hub.

The Cosmos Hub includes the transaction in a block and adds it to its blockchain then it is sent to Zone B.

Zone B after receiving the transaction updates its state and shows the tokens in its system.

The Cosmos SDK is a powerful tool for developers that allows them to build custom blockchain applications, depending on the features and components they need for their
application.
