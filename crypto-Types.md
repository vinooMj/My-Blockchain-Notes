There are 11 types of cryptos...

Did you know that there are 6,690 active cryptos being traded in 411 active exchanges across 47,725 active market pairs. 

Based on my analysis, these cryptos can be divided into 11 categories:

R = Ready money e.g. Bitcoin (BTC)
O = Open Blockchain Tokens e.g. Wrapped Asset Token (WRAP)
H = Hush coins e.g Monero (XMR)
A = Application coins e.g. Filecoin (FIL)
S = Security tokens e.g. Exodus

N = Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) e.g. Crypto Kitties
A = Algorithmic stablecoins e.g. Frax (FRAX)
G = Governance tokens e.g. Uniswap (UNI)
P = Public Blockchain natives e.g. Ether (ETH)
A = Asset backed tokens e.g. Tether (USDT)
L = Lending / Borrowing cryptos e.g. Aave (AAVE)

R = Ready money
Ready money cryptos are those that can be used to buy and sell stuff or which can be quickly converted to "cash".

Examples: Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Litecoin (LTC), and fiat-pegged stablecoins such as Tether (USDT).

O = Open Blockchain Tokens
An Open Blockchain Token (OBT) is a unique form of crypto recognized under the laws of Wyoming, US. An OBT must be exchangeable for specified consumptive purposes services e.g. software, content, or real/tangible personal property.

Example: Wrapped Asset Token (WRAP)

H = Hush coins
Did you know that Bitcoin isn't 100% anonymous? All its transactions are recorded on its publicly available Blockchain

A = Application coins
Application coins are those which are part of a specific use case.

Example: Filecoin (FIL) is the native crypto of the Filecoin network. It can be used to pay miners to store/distribute data and to retrieve information. Storage providers guarantee a minimum service level by providing FIL as collateral.

S = Security tokens 
Security tokens are like equity shares and represent ownership of a company

Example: Exodus

N = Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) e.g. Crypto Kitties
 The INR balance in your mobile wallet is fungible - every rupee is exactly the same as another rupee. Any one rupee can be exchanged for another one rupee. Things like real estate and art are non-fungible because no two of them are identical.

Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT) are the crypto versions of things like art, and real estate. They are used as digital proof-of-ownership of the underlying asset.

NFTs can be of many types, including art, collectibles (trading cards, sneakers), domains, virtual game items (avatars, skins, weapons, etc).

A = Algorithmic stablecoins
Algorithmic stablecoins are cryptos whose price stability is maintained by an algorithm. They are different from fiat-pegged stablecoins whose stability is maintained by the asset they have pegged to e.g. US dollar. 

Example: Frax (FRAX)

G = Governance tokens
Governance tokens gives holders a vote in a blockchain's development.

Example: Uniswap (UNI)

P = Public Blockchain natives
Using a public blockchain involves the payment of gas fees or transaction fees. This fee is payable in the native coin of that blockchain.

Example: Ether (ETH) 

A = Asset-backed tokens
An asset-backed token or a Wrapped Asset is a blockchain token pegged to or collateralized by an asset such as art, gold, fiat currency, debt instrument, equity shares, trade invoices, real estate, etc.

Itâ€™s called a "wrapped" asset or token because the original asset is put in a "wrapper" or "digital vault" that enables the wrapped version to be traded on a blockchain.

Example: Coffee coin

L = Lending / Borrowing cryptos
These tokens make it easy for investors to borrow and lend funds in a Decentralised Finance market.

Example: Aave (AAVE)
