Did you know that there are 6,690 active cryptos being traded in 411 active exchanges across 47,725 active market pairs. 

Based on my analysis, these cryptos can be divided into 11 categories:

O = Open Blockchain Tokens e.g. Wrapped Asset Token (WRAP)
H = Hush coins e.g Monero (XMR)
A = Application coins e.g. Filecoin (FIL)
