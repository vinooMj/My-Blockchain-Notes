Building a secure smart contract does require adhering to the Best Practices.
And one of the most crucial practices to keep in mind is the 𝐂𝐇𝐄𝐂𝐊 𝐄𝐅𝐅𝐄𝐂𝐓𝐒 𝐈𝐍𝐓𝐄𝐑𝐀𝐂𝐓𝐈𝐎𝐍 𝐏𝐚𝐭𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐧 while making External Calls.

𝐖𝐇𝐀𝐓 𝐞𝐱𝐚𝐜𝐭𝐥𝐲 𝐝𝐨𝐞𝐬 𝐢𝐭 𝐦𝐞𝐚𝐧?
In simple terms, it means that while designing a function in solidity, any state modification in the function must happen before an external call is made.

𝐖𝐇𝐘 𝐔𝐬𝐞 𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐬 𝐏𝐚𝐭𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐧?
Remember the DAO Hack of 2016 where the attacker drained 3.6 million ETH?
Well, one of the Imperative reasons behind that hack was the Violation of Check-Effects-Interaction patterns in function code.
(𝘊𝘩𝘦𝘤𝘬 𝘰𝘶𝘵 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘊𝘰𝘮𝘮𝘦𝘯𝘵 𝘚𝘦𝘤𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯 𝘧𝘰𝘳 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘛𝘦𝘤𝘩𝘯𝘪𝘤𝘢𝘭 𝘋𝘦𝘵𝘢𝘪𝘭𝘴)

Let's understand this by breaking down the 3 imperative steps in this pattern. (𝘔𝘰𝘴𝘵 𝘪𝘮𝘱𝘰𝘳𝘵𝘢𝘯𝘵𝘭𝘺, 𝘐𝘯 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘦𝘹𝘢𝘤𝘵 𝘰𝘳𝘥𝘦𝘳)

The first part is to implement a 𝘾𝙃𝙀𝘾𝙆 or input validations(𝘸𝘪𝘵𝘩 𝘳𝘦𝘲𝘶𝘪𝘳𝘦 𝘰𝘳 𝘢𝘴𝘴𝘦𝘳𝘵 𝘴𝘵𝘢𝘵𝘦𝘮𝘦𝘯𝘵𝘴) to ensure that arguments passed are valid and the function is ready
to be executed.

𝗘𝗙𝗙𝗘𝗖𝗧𝗦
Resolve all the 𝙀𝙁𝙁𝙀𝘾𝙏𝙎 to the State of the Contract. This part involves optimistically modifying the State Variables to a valid state in the protocol.

𝗜𝗡𝗧𝗘𝗥𝗔𝗖𝗧𝗜𝗢𝗡
The final step should include any 𝙄𝙉𝙏𝙀𝙍𝘼𝘾𝙏𝙄𝙊𝙉 with other external contracts. This is the step that should include any external call that is being made from the
function, at the very 
end of the function.

External calls must be the very last thing that you should do in a function.

Moreover, even if attackers try to re-enter a function that follows the CHECK-EFFECTS-INTERACTION pattern, they cannot really abuse the State of the contract as 
it has been already modified before the external call is made.
