What is Gossip protocol?

A process by which actors in a network exchange information with all other members.When an actor receives new information, it relays it to every other actor it's 
connected to that does not already have that information. Since all actors are cumulatively connected, eventually they all receive the information.

The main objective of a Gossip Protocol is to disseminate information as quickly as possible through a vast network of distributed nodes. To achieve this, these types of 
protocols start from the basic idea that processes that communicate regularly with their peers. During this communication they are able to exchange information by 
creating a high frequency and data flow over the network. And all this in a dispersion pattern that helps the information to be distributed as quickly as possible 
throughout the network.

Types:
-Broadcast protocol : Information dissemination or propagation protocols are those that operate under group or multicast communication for the dissemination of messages
-Aggregation protocol : In aggregation protocols, the peer network nodes receive and process information, to send a summary of this information to the other nodes 
connected to the network. This information distribution mechanism keeps a record of all processed data. This process is known as distributed data mining, which is 
widely used in distributed ledger technology.

Advantages :
- Scalability
- Sturdiness
- Fault Tolerance
- Decentralization

Currently being used by : Bitcoin, HashGraph, Apache Cassandra, Ripples, Dynamo, Consul

In conclusion, this protocol functions similar to epidemic algorithm. The main application of these protocols is to disseminate information, the Gossip Protocols have 
many more applications within information distribution networks. For example, they can be used to solve complicated problems in too large networks. They can also be used
to replicate complete databases and much more.
