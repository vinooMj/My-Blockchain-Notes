Ethereum

Founding Year : Dec 2013
Token Launch : July 2015
Launch Price : $ 0.31
All time high : $ 4865
All time low : $ 0.4209
Token sale funding : $ 16 mil
Total fund raised : $ 18.4 mil

This funds has been deployed to develop ETH ecosystem & To pay miners

Initial Funds used for :

- Customer Acquisitions
- Ecosystem Development
- Product Development

Ethereum Ecosystem :

Approx $ 18 million initial funding deployed to build Ethereum Ecosystem as below : Numbers are approx number , few are for 2021 & few are recently updated

No of Validators : 280,000
Total Eth staked : $ 30 Bil
No of developers : 3920
No of Daaps : 3000
Active Addresses : 5.5 million
Daily Transactions : 1.1 millio
Fees paid by users : $ 15 m/m
Total Defi TVL : $ 127 B
Revenue 2021 : $ 9.9 Billion

As of now tokens in circulation : 120 mil

Valuation Multiples:

MC : Marketcap of Eth : $ 215 B

1. MC/ TVL = $215 B /$ 127 B = 0.6 X

2. MC / Rev = $ 215 B / $ 9.9B = 22 X

Few of other indicators :

- Ethereum sells blocks every 15 seconds
- Block can fit 80 KB worth of transaction
- Speed of Ethereum : 30 TPS
- Cost of Transaction : $ 8-40

So here is raw data so that we can work out few measures such as below matrix to DYOR

- Ethereums LTV / CAC
- Ethereums LTV / EDC
- Capital Efficiency
- Mcap Multiples

-Ethereums LTV/CAC is at par
- Ethereum has efficiently deployed capital to develop ecosystem & generate revenues

- Alpha would like to define another term EDC : Ecosystem Development Cost & Ethereum would have excellent LTV/EDC ratio too

This rough data is purely to do DYOR ..
