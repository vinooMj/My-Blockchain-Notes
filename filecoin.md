Filecoin is a peer-to-peer network that allows anyone to store and retrieve data. There are storage providers who get paid if they provide 
the storage correctly to the users who want to store files on the network.

Filecoin network runs on 2 Consensus algorithms, 
Proof of Replica: Where the storage provider shows that he has stored the data correctly 
Proof of Spacetime: Where the network keeps on checking if the storage is done properly on a regular basis.

Filecoin virtual machine is the concept of adding the layer of Programmability to the storage layer. 
You can use the information stored on the network and build smart contracts on top of it. 
We denote smart contracts as Actors in the Filecoin network.

FVM is EVM compatible so developers can bring their favourite tools to build on top of Filecoin. 
The FVM reference SDK is written in Rust and is built using WebAssembly (WASM). 
This structure allows it to have foreign VMs on top of it.

Use cases of FVM? 
This is something which is really exciting as with Data plus the programmability, we can build so much stuff which creates a completely new version 
of the existing dapps. 

Dataverse/Data-centric DAOs: Now we can create DAOs where members can collectively take decisions on how to manage important data. 
Time capsules: You can lock particular information for a certain period of time. 

Filecoin is 4000x cheaper than AWS S3.

It’s got ~30 EXABYTES of cloud storage capacity.

That’s 2% of the entire global data center storage capacity.

It is a $100M ARR network. 

This is just one example of DePIN in action - and with cloud costs on peoples mind, how can they ignore Filecoin? 

Filecoin also provides these unique benefits: 
- Nobody can shut your data off
- Insane redundancy not possible with multicloud 
- Global availability
