ERC-6551 - your NFTs can now hold NFTs!

ERC-6551 is a new ERC standard that allows the ERC-721 NFTs to act as a token-bound account i.e. the NFTs can hold tokens, NFTs, and do 
much more. 

The most exciting use-case of ERC 6551 is that your NFTs can now act like your true digital identity. With ERC-721, the actual identities
were still the wallet holding the NFTs, but now this changes. Imagine logging into any dapp with your NFTs and collecting 
credentials (SBTs, NFTs) on your NFTs directly.

Gaming has strong implications too - your NFT character can hold its own token, wearables, weapons and much more, which you can directly
trade in one go.
