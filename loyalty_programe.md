Stop rewarding points, start building culture: 

How Web3 is flipping the script on brand loyalty for consumer brands👇

It all starts with the concept of (digital) ownership*: 

To “own” something means I possess it, and someone else doesn’t.

It's scarce, exclusive and makes me stand out and unique. 

It also gives me more agency in the projects, communities and ecosystems I participate in.
 
Ownership is a tool of self-expression, the basis of identity. 

Identities build communities. 

Communities build culture. 

Culture creates brands.
 
**The best brands are inherently cultural.**

Aleksija Vujicic from Multicoin Capital nailed this: 

“As religion declined across the Western world, consumers began to seek meaning, identity, and belonging elsewhere – such as influencers, or more importantly, from brands.

 It was not enough for brands to merely be attached to a subculture

—brands recognized the need to become culture.”

Nike is the perfect example of that: 

“For most brands, the product is very clearly the physical objects they sell: shoes, apparel and accessories. 

For Nike it’s something much bigger. It’s about powerful human ideas. When we buy Nike, we’re buying into a cultural story” – Doug Stephens
 
**Here’s where it gets interesting** 🤯
 
In the Web3 we imagine, NFTs function as digital artefacts that turn into vectors of identity for users.

An Internet of cultural assets only works if it spreads among users and communities. 

Locking cultural artefacts onto one platform will prevent the formation of culture and communities.

This is why in the Web3 we imagine, NFTs will be interoperable across platforms, across brand ecosystems. 
 
And this is what makes Web3 tech such a powerful tool for brands.💡🤯
 
For the first time, community and culture can be built on a digital, decentralized layer of trust and owned by the users.

Brand building in the Web3 we imagine becomes transparent, participative, and owned by the community. 

This is why a Web3 strategy is as much a marketing strategy as a customer strategy. 

It supercharges loyalty and enables community-led brands.
