Why can't we generate ZK proofs on-chain?

Only some years ago, generating almost any ZK proof would take hours. After that, a lot of research has flowed under the bridge, Nowadays, some ZK proofs can be generated in seconds, and some of them even nicely in your browser.

However, generating proofs is still a very demanding operation, requiring lots of computation. This is why it's not possible to do it on-chain in a blockchain - at least in any traditional public blockchain.

Now I'm asking you: what kind of use cases would become possible if we could generate proofs on-chain?

Oh, and if someone knows of a public, decentralized blockchain where it's possible to generate ZK proofs on-chain, do let me know!
