Real estate will eventually get tokenized and what that model could look like.


First, let me address what I mean by tokenized - tokens will be created to represent ownership of real estate. Since every piece of real estate is unique, 
NFTs would be a great way to represent them. These can also be fractionalized to allow for multiple owners.

If you have a token that represents a property, you have digital proof of ownership in your wallet. That can be plugged into other smart contracts. 
What can you do with that?

Mortgage / Refinance:
• It can take months to secure a typical mortgage.
• It requires all kinds of documentation.
• It requires a good credit score. Credit scores are an incredibly biased and unfair system.

In Defi, you can get a loan in seconds, as long as you have collateral to back it. When you get a mortgage, your house is the collateral. So 
if you have a token representing a property, you should be able to use that as collateral to get a loan in seconds in Defi.

Okay, so you'll be able to get a mortgage / refinance in seconds, not months. What else can we do with tokenized real estate?

In Traditional finance you have 2 options:
• Buy a property: Requires lots of capital required, physical access, and management, offers no diversification.
• Real Estate Investment Trusts or REITs: limited options, requires trust in managers, no granularity.

With tokenized real estate in Defi, you'd be able to:
• Invest from anywhere in the world
• Invest with a small amount of capital
• Invest in a specific property, or
• (potentially) Invest in index tokens that represent a neighbourhood, city, state, or country.
