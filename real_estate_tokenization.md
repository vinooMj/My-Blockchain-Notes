Real estate will eventually get tokenized and what that model could look like.


First, let me address what I mean by tokenized - tokens will be created to represent ownership of real estate. Since every piece of real estate is unique, 
NFTs would be a great way to represent them. These can also be fractionalized to allow for multiple owners.

If you have a token that represents a property, you have digital proof of ownership in your wallet. That can be plugged into other smart contracts. 
What can you do with that?

Mortgage / Refinance:
• It can take months to secure a typical mortgage.
• It requires all kinds of documentation.
• It requires a good credit score. Credit scores are an incredibly biased and unfair system.

In Defi, you can get a loan in seconds, as long as you have collateral to back it. When you get a mortgage, your house is the collateral. So 
if you have a token representing a property, you should be able to use that as collateral to get a loan in seconds in Defi.

Okay, so you'll be able to get a mortgage / refinance in seconds, not months. What else can we do with tokenized real estate?

In Traditional finance you have 2 options:
• Buy a property: Requires lots of capital required, physical access, and management, offers no diversification.
• Real Estate Investment Trusts or REITs: limited options, requires trust in managers, no granularity.

With tokenized real estate in Defi, you'd be able to:
• Invest from anywhere in the world
• Invest with a small amount of capital
• Invest in a specific property, or
• (potentially) Invest in index tokens that represent a neighbourhood, city, state, or country.


--
There is a common misconception that "Real estate Tokenization" is similar to how REITs (Real estate Investment Trusts) work.
There are some key differences that set it apart.

1, The digital tokens used in real estate #tokenization are called "Security Tokens" and are backed by underlying infrastructure assets.

2, Security tokens are governed and executed through smart contracts, which are self-enforcing and self-executing. These contracts are written as lines of code on top of an existing blockchain network. So that You have visibility & voting rights on that asset rather become a passive investor to wait for "Dividends" that they may share.

3, Tokens can be transferred to investors without the need for intermediaries such as brokers or contractors, So that you do not need to cut off your ROI as additional fees.

4, All relevant financial and statutory information is recorded immutably on the blockchain, making it impossible for humans to tamper with the data, Thus you complete control and visibility on the entire investment lifecycle.

5, Contractual terms and historical data are accessible to investors, regulators, and verifiers, bringing greater transparency, accuracy, and efficiency to the process.

Finally, newly minted tokens are transferred to investors' web-3 wallets, and they can transfer or trade their tokens on secondary markets, unlocking new possibilities such as instant liquidity and lending and borrowing capabilities.
