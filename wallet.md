How does a Cryptocurrency Wallet work?

It stores all the transaction records in the immutable blockchain network.
It operates in the form of a software program containing your private and public keys.
When a person sends his cryptos to another user’s wallet, he is transferring the ownership of the digital coins or tokens to the wallet address of the recipient.
The private key stored in your wallet must match the public address the currency is assigned to for unlocking the funds and utilizing them for various purposes.
The public key will be used to receive the funds and can be searched in the distributed ledger.
The private key is used to sign the transactions and prove that the user owns the related public key.

They can support different digital currencies and are seamlessly compatible with several web interfaces. Some famous hardware wallets are Trezor, Ledger Nano S, and KeepKey.
Paper wallets are easy to use and are highly secure. The software will automatically generate your private keys and public keys which can be printed. A user can easily transfer funds from their software wallet to the public address of their paper wallet. You can enter your private keys or scan the QR code on the paper wallet for transferring funds from it to your software wallet. A Bitcoin paper wallet can be printed at bitaddress org.
