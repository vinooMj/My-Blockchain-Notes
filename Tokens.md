Tokens:

Tokenization
Is the process of creating a digital representation of tangible (real estate, gold) or intangible (cryptocurrencies, carbon credits) assets on a blockchain.

Tokens give users property rights: the ability to own a piece of the internet.

The tokenization of assets opens many possibilities such as fractional ownership. For example, a real estate worth one million USD can be digitally represented in one million tokens so each token is $1.

This lowers the minimum capital requirements for many expensive asset classes such as art, collectibles and allows a crowdfunding style of investment making illiquid assets liquid.

Also, the change of ownership is settled nearly instantly and cheap compared to traditional means, and transparency of ownership is high as every transaction is saved immutable on the blockchain protocol.

Security token vs utility token:
Here is an analogy that can simplify your understanding of security and utility token. You can compare utility token to Amazon gift cards, which don’t guarantee any profit but lets you access Amazon services with some privileges. 
On the other hand, security tokens can be compared with Amazon share that may guarantee you profit depending on the price moment of Amazon share price.

Unregulated Initial Coin Offerings (ICO) which can be compared to IPO version of cryptocurrency.

Fungible & Nonfungible

ERC-20 Token Standard

ERC-20 is a standard on Ethereum used to code a class of fungible tokens.

Use cases of fungible tokens include:

    Digital currency or mediums of exchange such as stablecoins.
    Security tokens or crypto assets that are programmed to be stocks and bonds of the same class.
    
    STO:
    STOs are said to hold intrinsic value, they can guarantee interest, profit sharing, dividends, voting rights, and more.
    STOs are increasing in popularity. It is safe to say that they will be significantly more regulated than ICOs
    STOs embrace SEC requirements and regulatory oversight — acknowledging that they are there to protect investors against scams and bad investments.
