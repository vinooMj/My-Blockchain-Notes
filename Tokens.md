Tokens:

Tokenization
Is the process of creating a digital representation of tangible (real estate, gold) or intangible (cryptocurrencies, carbon credits) assets on a blockchain.

Tokens give users property rights: the ability to own a piece of the internet.

The tokenization of assets opens many possibilities such as fractional ownership. For example, a real estate worth one million USD can be digitally represented in one million tokens so each token is $1.

This lowers the minimum capital requirements for many expensive asset classes such as art, collectibles and allows a crowdfunding style of investment making illiquid assets liquid.

Also, the change of ownership is settled nearly instantly and cheap compared to traditional means, and transparency of ownership is high as every transaction is saved immutable on the blockchain protocol.

Security token vs utility token:
Here is an analogy that can simplify your understanding of security and utility token. You can compare utility token to Amazon gift cards, which don’t guarantee any profit but lets you access Amazon services with some privileges. 
On the other hand, security tokens can be compared with Amazon share that may guarantee you profit depending on the price moment of Amazon share price.

Unregulated Initial Coin Offerings (ICO) which can be compared to IPO version of cryptocurrency.

Fungible & Nonfungible

ERC-20 Token Standard

ERC-20 is a standard on Ethereum used to code a class of fungible tokens.

Use cases of fungible tokens include:

    Digital currency or mediums of exchange such as stablecoins.
    Security tokens or crypto assets that are programmed to be stocks and bonds of the same class.
    
    STO:
    STOs are said to hold intrinsic value, they can guarantee interest, profit sharing, dividends, voting rights, and more.
    STOs are increasing in popularity. It is safe to say that they will be significantly more regulated than ICOs
    STOs embrace SEC requirements and regulatory oversight — acknowledging that they are there to protect investors against scams and bad investments.
    STOs are said to hold intrinsic value, they can guarantee interest, profit sharing, dividends, voting rights, and more.



Tokens from Ethereum blockchain are called ERC-20

while tokens from Solana blockchain are called SPL tokens.



💫 Benefits of Tokens 💫

✅ Cost effective - no need to create your own blockchain network.

✅ Ease of use - You just “rent” an existing blockchain and run on it.

✅ Safety and Stability - obtained from an existing blockchain platform.

✅ Variety of uses - tokens can be used in many ways rather than just transactions.



💡The focus of a team behind a Crypto Coin is to maintain, develop, grow and improve their blockchain and its uses.

💡 The focus of a team behind a Token is to develop and to provide a great #web3 product.


⚡️ If a token project is growing quick enough, the developers can migrate from a Token to a Coin.

For instance:

Crypto.com started with an ERC-20 token called CRO.

Later on, they develop their own blockchain platform called Cronos Chain where they have a new version of CRO as a coin 🚀

Users with the original ERC-20 token CRO, were able to migrate to the new CRO coin 🪙



💫 Interesting thing to know is that some Coins working in other blockchains are represented as Tokens.

How❔

If you buy Ether in the Solana Blockchain, you are not buying straight Ether 🤯

Instead, you are buying a token representation of Ethereum in the Solana Blockchain called “Wrapped-Ethereum” 🌯

This token’s value is pegged to the Ether value ☑️

You can cash out your Wrapped-Ethereum anytime ☑️

If you send it to an Ethereum based exchange, the Wrapped-Ethereum will be first swapped to straight Ether, and then “moved out” from the Solana Blockchain ☑️

Is there any advantage to this❔

Yes❕

A regular Ethereum transaction has an average Gas fee of $20 ⚠️

However a transaction in the Solana Blockchain is only $0.00025 💥

Huge difference 💸

In theory, you can purchase more Ether in the Solana Blockchain since you are saving on transaction costs.

That is why a Solana based crypto exchange called FTX has the lowest fees ☝🏼

That is a small part of what is called Crypto coin Arbitrage 🤓
