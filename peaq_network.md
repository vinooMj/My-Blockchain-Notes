Peaq is a blockchain-based protocol and network designed to facilitate decentralized financial services and asset tokenization.
It aims to provide a scalable and secure infrastructure for creating, issuing, and managing digital assets on the blockchain.

The Peaq network utilizes a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure, similar to other blockchain projects like IOTA. DAGs offer
advantages such as high scalability, fast transaction confirmation times, and low fees. The network is built to handle a large number
of transactions per second, making it suitable for various financial applications.

One of the primary use cases of Peaq is asset tokenization. It enables the creation of digital representations of real-world assets, 
such as real estate, commodities, or intellectual property rights. These digital assets can be traded, transferred, and tracked on 
the Peaq network, providing liquidity and fractional ownership opportunities.

Peaq aims to provide interoperability with other blockchain networks and protocols, allowing seamless asset transfers and interactions 
between different systems. It also incorporates smart contract functionality, enabling the execution of programmable agreements and 
automated actions.

The native cryptocurrency of the Peaq network is called the PQA token. PQA tokens are used for transaction fees, network participation, 
and as a means of exchange within the ecosystem.

It's important to note that while the information provided here is based on the knowledge available up until September 2021, the Peaq 
network may have undergone updates or changes since then. I recommend visiting the official Peaq website or referring to their official
documentation for the most up-to-date and accurate information.
