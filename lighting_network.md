Step 0: Bob wants to transfer 1 BTC to Alice.

Step 1: Bob and Alice establish a channel, which is a wallet that must be signed by both Bob and Alice. Both parties can deposit BTC into the wallet.

Step 2: The deposit transaction is sent to the blockchain to package and confirm.

Step 3: Now the channel is opened, Bob and Alice can trade money. For example, Bob can send 0.01 BTC each time and send 100 times. These transactions are not sent to 
the blockchain.

Steps 4 and 5: After 1 BTC is transferred, the channel can be closed. This last transaction is sent to the blockchain. If there is any residuals in the wallet, it’s 
returned to Bob and Alice’s wallets.
