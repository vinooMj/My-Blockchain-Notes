WHAT ARE NODES AND CLIENTS?

👨‍💻 A "node" is any instance of Ethereum client software that is connected to other computers also running Ethereum software, forming a network.
A client is an implementation of Ethereum that verifies data against the protocol rules and keeps the network secure.

👨‍💻 Post-Merge Ethereum consists of two parts: the execution layer and the consensus layer. Both layers are run by different client software. On this page, we'll refer to them as the execution client and consensus client.

👨‍💻The execution client (also known as the Execution Engine, EL client or formerly the Eth1 client) listens to new transactions 
broadcasted in the network, executes them in EVM, and holds the latest state and database of all current Ethereum data.
 
👨‍💻 The consensus client (also known as the Beacon Node, CL client or formerly the Eth2 client) implements the proof-of-stake consensus 
algorithm, which enables the network to achieve agreement based on validated data from the execution client.

👨‍💻 Before The Merge, consensus and execution layer were separate networks, with all transactions and user activity on the Ethereum 
happening at what is now the execution layer. One client software provided both execution environment and consensus verification of 
blocks produced by miners. The consensus layer, the Beacon Chain, has been running separately since December 2020. It introduced 
proof-of-stake and coordinated the network of validators based on data from the Ethereum network.

👨‍💻 With the Merge, Ethereum transitions to proof-of-stake by connecting these networks. Execution and consensus clients work together 
to verify Ethereum's state.
Modular design with various software pieces working together is called encapsulated complexity

ecosystem.
