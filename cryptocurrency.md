Cryptocurrency is a form of digital currency based on a crypto net-
work that is distributed across a large number of computers that is se-
cured by cryptography [1]. which makes it almost difficult to fake and
double spend. The majority of cryptocurrencies are decentralized net-
works built on blockchain technology, with a distributed ledger enforced
by a diverse network of computers. The most essential aspect of decen-
tralized currencies is that they are not issued by any central body. Thatâ€™s
why it is outside the control of the banks and not backed by a central
government. The Cryptocurrency world is immune to the old methods of
government to control transaction and interference.
