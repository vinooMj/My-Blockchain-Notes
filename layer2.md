Ethereum vs Polygon (Previously Matic):

Imagine everyone in your city driving their own car to work. The roads would be jammed due to high traffic. This would lead to slow (infact extremely slow)
movement of traffic and this kind of commute will be very expensive for each individual because every car will consume 
petrol (or gas, as the Americans like to call it).

This can be solved if everyones takes a bus instead. Each bus will transport multiple people, hence reducing the congestion on road,
leading to faster movement of the traffic collectively. On top of that, every individual will have to pay only a fraction of what they would have spent u
sing their own car.

That's how 'Layer-2' solutions like Polygon resolve the high traffic issues for 'Layer-1' chains like Ethereum. 
Referring to the previous example, consider the road as Ethereum that has high traffic. Ethereum can currently process ~15 transactions per second. 
This leads to congestion for individual transactions (cars) and high price for using the network (called gas fee).

If we use a bus (Polygon/Layer-2), the traffic will become more efficient, although we're still running the bus on the road. 
Talking in very simple terms, Polygon chain kind of combines multiple transactions and then passes the summary through layer-1 chain as a single transaction.. Hence, reducing traffic and cost significantly. Thus Layer-2 solutions complement the Layer-1 chain.
