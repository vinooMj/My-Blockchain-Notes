Matic Network is a decentralized platform using an adapted version of Plasma framework that provides a solution for faster and extremely low cost transactions with finality on a main chain.

Thus to overcome these issues, Matic Blockchain comes into role. Matic is a layer 2 solution that focuses on reducing high gas fees cost, transactions speed, and providing a better user experience. Moreover, Matic is similar to other solutions such as Polkadot, Cosmos, etc. but it has 3 major upsides which are:
1 It can fully benefit from Ethereum’s network effects.
2 It is inherently more secure.
3 It is more open and powerful

Is Matic More Than A Layer-2 Solution?
Yes, Matic is more than a layer-2 solution because it has many key features apart from providing lesser gas fees and fast transactions throughput.
Key Features
Given below are the key features of Matic which make it more than a layer-2 solution.
1 Security: Matic provides three types of security models for a developer to build their DApp upon:
A. Proof of Stake security: Proof Of Stake security is achieved by the Heimdall & Bor layer which is built on top of Tendermint. Moreover, To enable POS mechanism a set of management smart contracts are employed on ethereum
B. Plasma security: Matic mechanism provides plasma guarantees with respect to various attack scenarios. Two main cases considered are:
Chain operator (or in Matic, the Heimdall layer) is corrupt
The user is corrupt
C. Hybrid (Plasma + PoS): Developers can follow this approach for their DApps as hybrid consists of key features of both POS and Plasma security.
2 Polygon Chains: Polygon offers two types of ethereum-compatible networks that are:
A Stand-Alone Chains: Stand-alone networks are fully in charge of their own security, i.e. have their own pool of validators. Also, they offer the highest level of independence and flexibility.
B Secured Chains: Secured chains offer a high level of security, with the tradeoff of sacrificing a portion of independence and flexibility.
3 Scalability: Matic is a scalable network as it offers fast, low-rate, and secure transactions on its’s mainchain.
4 Bridging: A bridge is basically a set of smart contracts which helps in moving your assets from root chain to child chain. Matic has two types of bridges:
A. Plasma Bridge: Plasma bridge guarantees more security because of its Plasma exit mechanism. However, there are some restrictions on the child token and there is a 7-day withdrawal period associated with all exits/withdraws from Matic to Ethereum on the Plasma bridge.
B. POS (Proof Of Stake) Bridge: POS bridge is comparatively more flexible than plasma bridge and offers faster withdrawals. Moreover, it is widely used by developers because they are happy with its level of security as it is secured by a robust set of external validators.
5 User Experience: Matic provides a smooth UX and developer abstraction from the main chain to the Matic chain. It extends by giving SDKs with wallet connect support.
Thus, by going through all the features we can understand, and Hence, it is proved that the Matic project has a lot of potentials and is more than a layer-2 solution.
