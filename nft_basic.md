Base functionality of NFTs:                                 
-   Minting an NFT means converting digital data into crypto collections or digital assets recorded on the blockchain. 
-   Token burn means they have been permanently pulled out of circulation by transferring those tokens to a ‘dead wallet’. 
-   The private key for this wallet is unknown, so the crypto is lost forever.
-   Buying and selling is possible via different market places
-   NFT royalties give the person who minted it a percentage of the sale price each time the NFT creation is sold on a marketplace. 

Things always start much earlier than expected and take a while to develop: 2012-2016 are the #Early History of NFTs: Long before #Ethereum existed, the concept was already thought up when in 2012, a paper by Meni Rosenfield was released that introduced the ‘Colored Coins’ concept for the Bitcoin blockchain.

There are many different use cases from profile pictures to gaming, art & music, to utility items, tickets and even investments.

NFTs can be saved via (1) #centralized storage, (2) #decentralized storage, (3) decentralized repairable storage and (4) #onchain. The asset itself is mostly not on the blockchain as storing it on-chain is too expensive. #CryptoPunks are an exception: Larva Labs announced in August 2021 that it 
had placed all the artwork for the existing CryptoPunks on the Ethereum blockchain.
