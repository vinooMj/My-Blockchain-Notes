Operation Model of Uniswap Labs

Uniswap remains focused on its core product, AMM, by choosing the development direction to optimise capital (Capital Eficiency).

The operation process of Uniswap currently takes place as follows, which will basically include 4 steps:

[1] Liquidity Provider will take the first step to provide liquidity and receive NFT LP tokens representing its ownership of assets in the Pool.

[2] Traders when trading, swapping in Uniswap Pools will have to pay a part of the transaction fee for Protocol.

[3] The transaction fee will be divided into 2 parts:
Much of it will go to Fees Vaults to give back to Liquidity Providers.

About 10-25% will go to Uniswap Treasury.

[4] Finally, Liquidity Providers who want to receive transaction fees can go to Fees vaults to claim fees.

If compared with the operating model of Uniswap V2, the operating model of Uniswap V3 is a big change. You can see some new component words in Uniswap 
Operating Model such as NFT, Uniswap Treasury, Fees Vaults,...

However, these components are only the surface of the change, the most important change comes from the infrastructure of Uniswap V3, these changes have 
deeply affected each step (1), ( 2), (3), (4) in Uniswap Operating Procedure, especially affecting step (1) Liquidity Provision.

These major changes include:

- Enables focus liquidity.
- Multiple transaction fees.

Only 2 changes, but they have opened up many new features on Uniswap thereby creating more use cases on this project, some of the new features can
be mentioned as:

- Capital Optimisation: Higher ROI, Less Risk.
- Range orders: Allows placing limit orders, take profit orders, buy the dip,...
- Develop a strategy for providing liquidity.
- NFT Liquidity.
- Developing more types of Pools, etc.
