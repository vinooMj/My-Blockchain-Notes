ZERO KNOWLEDGE PROOF (Let's break it down):

- The large Corporates use your personal data like your favourite content, taste and behavioural patterns to show you relevant Ads. 

- You can choose to uninstall the app and protect this. But it's not always that easy. How would you live without Google, Meta or Amazon?

- We have no option other than to consent to these companies to use our data. If you want to use their services, you have to compromise on Privacy. 

- But what if there is a way in which we can provide the companies with the data they need, without actually providing the actual data?

For Example: Banks could use this technology to give eligibility criteria checks for the end-users. So you can have a salary range set and if 
the entered salary is within that range, the end-user would be eligible for the loan. 

In this way, the companies do not actually get to know what is the exact salary as we can program the Smart Contract to perform this calculation 
without revealing the user input value. 

This process of proving something is true without revealing that the thing was proven. This is Zero-Knowledge proof and has got a lot of applications 
in Privacy for the upcoming generation.
