ZERO KNOWLEDGE PROOF (Let's break it down):

- The large Corporates use your personal data like your favourite content, taste and behavioural patterns to show you relevant Ads. 

- You can choose to uninstall the app and protect this. But it's not always that easy. How would you live without Google, Meta or Amazon?

- We have no option other than to consent to these companies to use our data. If you want to use their services, you have to compromise on Privacy. 

- But what if there is a way in which we can provide the companies with the data they need, without actually providing the actual data?

For Example: Banks could use this technology to give eligibility criteria checks for the end-users. So you can have a salary range set and if 
the entered salary is within that range, the end-user would be eligible for the loan. 

In this way, the companies do not actually get to know what is the exact salary as we can program the Smart Contract to perform this calculation 
without revealing the user input value. 

This process of proving something is true without revealing that the thing was proven. This is Zero-Knowledge proof and has got a lot of applications 
in Privacy for the upcoming generation.

#ZKPs were invented by Goldasser, Micali and Rackoff in 1982 and have since been used in many settings, a unique method where user A can prove to user B that he/she knows an absolute value "x" without revealing any extra information other than the fact that he/she knows "x". If a user wants to prove "x", he would be required to know the secret information. This way the verifier would not be able to relay the information to others without knowing the secret info.

𝐒𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐝𝐧𝐞𝐬𝐬: If both users adhere to the rules, the verifier will be persuaded without any further assistance from the user.
𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐞𝐭𝐞𝐧𝐞𝐬𝐬: If the assertion is untrue, the verifier would be unconvinced under any circumstances (method is probabilistically checked to ensure that the probability of falsehood is equal to zero)
𝐙𝐞𝐫𝐨-𝐤𝐧𝐨𝐰𝐥𝐞𝐝𝐠𝐞: The verifier would have no further information in either circumstance.

◾️ Require the prover to do a sequence of acts to persuade the verifier of a given truth
◾️ Sequence of activities is linked to mathematical probability principles

◾️ Prover might design all difficulties, and the verifier could reply afterward
◾️ Collusion is less likely with non-interactive ZKPs

◾️ Lately developed
◾️ Most common zero-knowledge proof techniques are zk-SNARK (will write about it in another post)
◾️ Defining public and private data though quadratic equation, then verifier may verify the transaction evidence to complete it

◾️ Its simplicity
◾️ Robust security due to the requirement that no information be revealed
◾️ Increased #privacy of users by avoiding the reveal of personal information in public blockchains
◾️ Increased blockchain throughput and scalability
 
𝐃𝐢𝐬𝐚𝐝𝐯𝐚𝐧𝐭𝐚𝐠𝐞𝐬 𝐨𝐟 𝐙𝐊𝐏
◾️ Rely on mathematical equations and numerical answers
◾️ Inefficient in time to complete due to containing around 2K/transaction
◾️ Restricted as if originator of a transaction forgets their information, all the data associated with it is lost
◾️ Potential vulnerability to advanced technologies like quantum computing

Zero-knowledge proofs will play a major role in the future of #Web3, #DeFi and #metaverse to share information securely that is necessary to gain access to goods and services without disclosing personal #data that could make a user susceptible to hacking and identity theft.
