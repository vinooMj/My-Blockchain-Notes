ZERO KNOWLEDGE PROOF (Let's break it down):

- The large Corporates use your personal data like your favourite content, taste and behavioural patterns to show you relevant Ads. 

- You can choose to uninstall the app and protect this. But it's not always that easy. How would you live without Google, Meta or Amazon?

- We have no option other than to consent to these companies to use our data. If you want to use their services, you have to compromise on Privacy. 

- But what if there is a way in which we can provide the companies with the data they need, without actually providing the actual data?

For Example: Banks could use this technology to give eligibility criteria checks for the end-users. So you can have a salary range set and if 
the entered salary is within that range, the end-user would be eligible for the loan. 

In this way, the companies do not actually get to know what is the exact salary as we can program the Smart Contract to perform this calculation 
without revealing the user input value. 

This process of proving something is true without revealing that the thing was proven. This is Zero-Knowledge proof and has got a lot of applications 
in Privacy for the upcoming generation.

#ZKPs were invented by Goldasser, Micali and Rackoff in 1982 and have since been used in many settings, a unique method where user A can prove to user B that he/she knows an absolute value "x" without revealing any extra information other than the fact that he/she knows "x". If a user wants to prove "x", he would be required to know the secret information. This way the verifier would not be able to relay the information to others without knowing the secret info.

𝐒𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐝𝐧𝐞𝐬𝐬: If both users adhere to the rules, the verifier will be persuaded without any further assistance from the user.
𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐞𝐭𝐞𝐧𝐞𝐬𝐬: If the assertion is untrue, the verifier would be unconvinced under any circumstances (method is probabilistically checked to ensure that the probability of falsehood is equal to zero)
𝐙𝐞𝐫𝐨-𝐤𝐧𝐨𝐰𝐥𝐞𝐝𝐠𝐞: The verifier would have no further information in either circumstance.

Zero-knowledge proofs will play a major role in the future of #Web3, #DeFi and #metaverse to share information securely that is necessary to gain access to goods and services without disclosing personal #data that could make a user susceptible to hacking and identity theft.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Zero knowledge proofs are one of the most significant crypto technologies being developed
Here are five ways zero knowledge proofs are making dapps more #efficient, #private & #decentralised

1. MultiPlayer games on chain - #darkforest

DarkForest is a #multiplayer game completely on-chain where players compete in rounds. Players start on a planet & can conquer other unconquered planets or planets of other players
The goal is to get as many points as possible

How ZK helps?

Both the location of the player's planet and the moves that they make are hidden from other players
Players generate ZK proofs on their system & publish them on the blockchain where the #contract verifies that the moves they are making are valid.

2. Private Transactions - #TornadoCash

Tornado #cash enables users to transfer their #ETH to a different account in a private way. Users deposit ETH into a pool & can withdraw those ETH from the pool using a diff account.

ZK helps break the link between the #deposit and #withdrawal .

How ZK helps ?

While depositing users submit the hash of a secret.
While withdrawing users submit a ZK Proof that they know the secret without revealing which #secret they know.
This enables them to #withdraw their ETH without revealing which #deposit was theirs

3. Proof of Storage - #filecoin

Filecoin enables everyone to store their data in a #decentralised manner.
Every storage provider must submit two proofs
1. Proof of replication(PoRep)- data was downloaded by provider
2. Proof of space time(PoSt)- data is still being stored.

How ZK helps?

Using ZK, filecoin compresses both PoRep & PoSt from 100s of KBs to 192Bs, a reduction of 10000!. Each storage provider generates 10 ZKPs each for PoRep & PoSt respectively.
These ZKPs can be very cheaply verified on #chain, saving both bandwidth & mining costs

4. Private Identity & Credentials - #identhree

Iden3 enables solutions like #polygon
 where users share information about their data while keeping it private
Eg. proving you are a DAO member without disclosing your #identity. Or that you are above 18 yrs w/o sharing your age

How ZK helps?

Users can submit proofs to the #DAO that they are one of the member addresses without revealing which #address is them

Users can also submit proofs that they hold a valid document (>18 age) without #revealing the actual details of that document.

5. Proof of Alpha #minaprotocol

 helps traders & funds verify that they actually made a #profit in their trades without revealing the real #trades.
LPs or followers can verify trader's #profitability without knowing which trades or #investments were executed.

How ZK helps?

#Traders can link their exchange #accounts to an application which fetches all their trading history.
It generates a ZKP of the profit without revealing the actual trades.

--------------------------
A ZK-proof is based on verifiable algorithms that take input data and return "true" or "false" without revealing the contents of the statement or how the truth was discovered.

A ZK-proof must be the following:

- finished (all valid inputs return true)
- sound (all invalid inputs return false)
- zero-knowledge (the party requesting verification learns nothing new about the statement).

ZK-proofs are a class of mathematical tools with applications that extend far beyond cryptography and cryptocurrency, but the technology has significant implications for on-chain privacy and scalability.

ZK-technology is still in its infancy. Proof generation is extremely difficult and computationally expensive. Verifying proofs is also expensive (though not significantly so).

Current implementations have several significant flaws:

- Some ZK-proofs require a reference string generated by trusted parties.

- Quantum computers are vulnerable to some ZK-proofs.

Fortunately, progress is quick and accelerating.

In summary, ZK-proofs allow one party (prover) to prove to another party (verifier) that a statement is true while also ensuring that the prover does not give the verifier any information that the verifier does not already have. All with cryptographic and mathematical assurance.
