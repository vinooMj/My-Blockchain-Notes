As the name suggests, itâ€™s about NFTs that change over time, e.g. by adding continuous data to them. 

A use case can be your car and its history of it. Each day a new dataset gets added. Each accident gets recorded and each visit to the garage gets tracked. ðŸ¥³

Oracles are responsible for bringing these data to the NFT. ChainLink is a possible solution here.
