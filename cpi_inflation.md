What is CPI? More importantly, how does it affect Bitcoin?

CPI (Consumer Price Index) is a study that understands the price change of multiple commodities to calculate inflation.

In order to measure the CPI, the US BIS put various economists in charge of collecting the change in the price of most goods and services used by 
consumers.

These experts survey households for a fixed list of items, including food, apparel, electronics, etc, which helps the government calculate inflation. 

To illustrate this: Let's say, an apple that used to cost $1 on June 14th is now $1.5 on July 14th. So, the surveyor will calculate the price change 
over a period of one month to understand the inflation along with the buying pattern of consumers and their behavior. 

An important point to understand here is that the higher the CPI, the costlier the goods and services.

The recent report of CPI by US BIS shows a 9.1% increase in the period of 12 months ending June. It simply means the same Apple is going to cost 9.1% 
more than what it was 12 months ago. 

Ideally, when inflation rises, the value of money depreciates, and to beat this recurring problem, people invest in assets like crypto.

If that's the case, why did Bitcoin drop yesterday?

A reasonable argument could be Bitcoin's short history of 13 years that doesn't allow it to act as an inflation hedge for now. 

Another argument could be that BTC is tied more to growth than inflation. It has its own patterns and speculative cycles. When markets get saturated, 
it makes sense BTC will drop, irrespective of what CPI and GDP data suggest.
