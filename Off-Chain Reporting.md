OCR (Off-Chain Reporting) is a feature provided by Chainlink, a decentralized oracle network. Chainlink's OCR functionality allows
data to be securely retrieved and processed off-chain, providing accurate and reliable information to smart contracts on the blockchain.

Traditionally, oracles are responsible for fetching data from external sources and delivering it to smart contracts. However, 
relying solely on on-chain computation for complex data processing can be expensive and time-consuming. OCR addresses these limitations
by offloading data computation and aggregation tasks to external nodes, reducing costs and improving scalability.

With OCR, Chainlink leverages a network of off-chain oracles to retrieve data from various sources, perform computations, and deliver
aggregated results to smart contracts. It enhances the accuracy, reliability, and speed of data delivery, making Chainlink a robust 
solution for connecting blockchain-based applications with real-world data.

OCR helps ensure that the data provided to smart contracts is tamper-resistant and trustworthy, as multiple independent oracles can 
independently validate and report the same data point. It also enables Chainlink to support a wider range of data types, including market
data, APIs, sports scores, weather information, and more.

In summary, OCR in the context of Chainlink refers to the off-chain data processing and aggregation capabilities provided by the Chainlink 
network, allowing smart contracts to access reliable and accurate data from external sources.
