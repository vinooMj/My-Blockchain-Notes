Did you know?

1. What is Ether (ETH)?

Name: Ether

Symbol: ETH

Overview:

Ether (ETH) is Ethereum's native cryptocurrency and should not be confused with ETC which is the native crypto of Ethereum Classic.

ETH is the fuel for the execution of decentralized smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.

Gas is the fee, measured in Gwei (0.000000001 ETH), that is required to successfully conduct a transaction on Ethereum.

Wei is the smallest fraction of an Ether. One ETH equals 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 Wei.

The most popular Ethereum tokens are:


Stablecoins, which mirror the value of fiat currencies like the US dollars.


Governance tokens, which represent voting power in decentralized organizations.


Collectible tokens / non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that represent a collectible, piece of digital art, etc.

Consensus mechanism: Proof of Work

Note:


Circulating Supply is the number of coins / tokens in public hands.


Total Supply is the number of coins / tokens created minus the number burned.

Note:


Market cap = Current Price x Circulating Supply


Fully Diluted Market Cap is the market cap if the maximum supply was in circulation


Volume (24h) is the fiat value of this crypto traded over the last 24 hours


Dominance measures a crypto's total market capitalization relative to the total market cap of all cryptos


Volume / market cap ratio = 24h Volume / Marketcap
