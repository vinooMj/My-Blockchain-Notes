Navigating Blockchain Bridges 


🔗Blockchains tends to built with their own unique systems and mechanisms which makes communication tough.

Blockchain Bridges essentially enable communication between different blockchains.

✔️To establish trust between blockchains and make two-way communication possible, bridges are used.They make it possible to not only transfer messages,
data, and resources between different blockchains but also make cross-chain asset transfer. 

🔸This changes things, as blockchains are no longer limited to one-way communication, as bridges enable them to communicate with other blockchains back
and forth.

🟡Bridges use different mechanisms, or actors, that play the role of verifiers between blockchains to enable communication and overcome the trust 
boundaries. Without these off-chain actors, communication between blockchains will not be possible.

🔸The role of verifiers is the main differentiator in how bridges work.

🟢Moreover, we see different types of bridge designs because of the interoperability trilemma in the crypto ecosystem

🔵The interoperability trilemma states that “interoperability protocols or bridges can only have two of the following three properties:

✔️Trustlessness: having equivalent security to the underlying domains.
✔️Extensibility: able to be supported on any domain.
✔️Generalisability: capable of handling arbitrary cross-domain data.”

Also, in his article, Arjun Bhuptani classifies bridges based on how they are verified into natively, externally, and locally verified systems. 

🟠Bridges can also be classified based on the mechanism they use to move assets across chains. Generally, based on how they move assets, bridges fall 
into the following buckets:

☑️Lock & Mint — These bridges lock assets on the source chain and mint assets on the destination chain. Examples: Polygon’s PoS bridge,
Avalanche Bridge (AB), wrapped BTC, wMonero.
☑️Burn & Mint — These bridges burn assets on the source chain and mint assets on the destination chain. Examples: Hop, Across.
☑️Atomic Swaps — These bridges swap assets on the source chain for assets on the destination chain. Generally, they are more trustless because 
they rely on self-executing smart contracts for asset swaps and remove the requirement for a trusted third-party necessary in lock & mint or burn & 
mint mechanisms. Examples: cBridge, Connext.
