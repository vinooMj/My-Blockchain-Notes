How does it raise funds?
.
The diagram below shows the evolution of a web3 company.

It usually starts with MVP (Minimal Viable Product). If it is a good PMF (Product Market Fit), the company can raise more money from the investors to hire more people to
expand the business. This goes on and on until the company goes IPO (Initial Public Offering) on a stock exchange.

▶ It starts from a 𝐰𝐡𝐢𝐭𝐞 𝐩𝐚𝐩𝐞𝐫 about rebuilding the world. Then you can write several lines of smart contract code to 𝐢𝐬𝐬𝐮𝐞 𝐚 𝐧𝐞𝐰 𝐭𝐨𝐤𝐞𝐧 (ICO, Initial Coin Offering). 
The token can be listed on an exchange (IEO, Initial Exchange Offering) to raise funds.

▶ At this point, some project initiators might run away with the money collected (𝐫𝐮𝐠 𝐩𝐮𝐥𝐥).

▶ A normal web3 company leverages 𝐭𝐨𝐤𝐞𝐧𝐨𝐦𝐢𝐜𝐬 (token + economics) to build a community of token holders and awards the early community members with more tokens. 
This behavior pushes the token price to go up and attracts more community members. Then more people are involved in building the products.

▶ On a bad day, the tokens in the project treasury might be stolen by 𝐡𝐚𝐜𝐤𝐞𝐫𝐬…

▶ If everything goes well, the token price goes to the moon. 

 Do you spot the differences? 
The funding is so direct in a web3 company due to the 𝐰𝐞𝐚𝐥𝐭𝐡 𝐞𝐟𝐟𝐞𝐜𝐭 in the past bull market.

And the flywheel is mainly pushed forward by tokenomics instead of the user base.

There are plenty of web 3 companies that don’t issue tokens, which makes their lifecycle look like a traditional company.
