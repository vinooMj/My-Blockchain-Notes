What's a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)?

Decentralization: Decentralization or decentralization is the process by which the activities of an organization, particularly those regarding planning and decision making, are distributed or delegated away from a central, authoritative location or group

Autonomous: having the freedom to govern itself or control its own affairs.

Organization: an organized group of people with a particular purpose, such as a business or government department


Given the definition of these 3 blocks making up the concept of a DAO then what's actually a DAO?

The word DAO was brought to mainlight in 2013 by EOS co-founder Dan Larimer and over the years we have seen the exponential growth of DAO being effectively used.

We can say that DAO is a distributed organization of people given rights to making decisions governing the whole body or an organization.

DAO works as a decentralized organization working on the Blockchain which is autonomously governed with predefined rules and regulations made possible by what is known as Smart Contract which is made upgradeable for accepting users' votes per time.

Smart Contract is the power behind Blockchains which makes it run without anyone's intervention. It's a programmed code of rules and guides a protocol is running by.

Next is How Do DAO Members Make Decisions?

DAO members make decisions through a tool known as VOTING.
Voting is a system through which members of the DAOs use to make decisions on a protocol.
DAO creates a token which voting power is attached to and is also used to run the protocol. Each member is allocated a voting power which is attributed to how many tokens owned, so the more your tokens the more you'll be attributed power to make decision on a protocol.
