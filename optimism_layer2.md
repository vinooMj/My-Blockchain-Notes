What Is Optimism?

Optimism is a layer 2 project for Ethereum consisting of 3 main components:

Ethereum mainnet: Optimism's security platform.

Optimistic Rollup: The core of Optimism's scalability. This is a layer 2 solution to help make transactions fast and cheap but still, 
keep the security from L1.

Optimistic Virtual Machine (OVM): A virtual machine compatible with Ethereum, making projects work like they are on L1 Ethereum.

The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is the environment for running Ethereum's smart contracts. Simply put, OVM is a scalable EVM that 
handles a large number of smart contracts.
