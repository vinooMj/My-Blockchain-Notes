Identity verification is away to ensure that there is a real person behind a specific process and to confirm they are the person they claim to be. 
This keeps a system in place and tries to prevent criminals from claiming to be someone else. 
You can prove your identity with passports, a drivers license and many other legal documents depending on where you are located. However, this system isn’t 
impenetrable, it’s possible to forge an identity and criminals know it too well.

Why can #NFTs play a big role? Especially in a digitally-native world, NFTs can play crucial part of identity verification and physical documents 
is an outdated concept as we need to think about the ones who don't have an #ID due to wars, corruption, natural disasters and poverty. 
It is a crucial and lifechanging part to digitally distinguish the provenance without needing both parties involved to even hold a document.

To prove ownership of an asset, both #digital & physical, anything ranging from art, virtual items, #realestate or shares and many others, 
#NFTs is the way by utilising #blockchain.

A core concept of a blockchain is #decentralisation. Blockchains do not need a centralised figure to control the network, the #data on a 
blockchain is stored on computers and systems split all across the world, this stops hackers from trying to breach it, a trustless system.

The ideal procedure to check the #identity of someone through an #NFT would be to read the blockchain. Every singular NFT would hold the data for 
a specific form of verification, like name, birth date, address, etc. Everyone has an “ID” associated with them and they can sign that document with their 
ID making it impossible for a “fake ID” to be “added” onto a blockchain. To add onto this point, the data does not have to be on-chain on the 
#Ethereum blockchain for example. The NFT would act as an “access key” to prove you own an “ID”.

If we think outside the box and take away #collectibles, #gaming and #art and replace them by "#provenance" and "unique ownership" a
whole new spectrum opens up.

There is still a long way to go and we still need to figure out questions like "who is the authority" in the first place, but at the end NFTs 
can be anything which needs a history and that makes it basically everything! We just need to open our minds!
