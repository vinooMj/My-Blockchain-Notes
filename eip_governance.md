Blockchain governance

Why do we need governance in the blockchain even though it is decentralized?
Blockchain, like all other Softwares, needs updates, bug fixes, protocol changes, etc.
Blockchain Governance is the process of deciding on block verification rules and APIs.
There are two types of blockchain governance: off-chain governance (by Bitcoin, Ethereum) and on-chain governance (by Tezos).

Off-chain governance is more like a political process, taking into account the opinion of stakeholders regarding a particular issue, 
but one opinion prevails.
In on-chain governance, developers propose rule changes through code updates, and nodes can vote. The more Mining Power or Funds a node controls, 
the more weight their vote carries.

Ethereum has an off-chain governance called Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs).
EIPs describe standards for the Ethereum platform, including core protocol specifications, client APIs, and contract standards 
[cited from eips.ethereum.org].

There are three types of EIPs:
1- Standard Track EIP: Describe processes affecting most or all Ethereum implementations such as network protocol changes, changes in block or 
transaction validity rules, application standards, etc.
2- Meta EIP: Describe processes that do not directly affect the code, such as process improvements, policies, procedures, etc
3- Informative EIP: Describe design issues.

Examples of the most well-known EIPs are: 
- EIP-20 which introduced the Token Standard aka ERC20.
- EIP-721 which introduced the Non-Fungible Token Standard aka ERC721.
- EIP1155 which introduced the Multi Token Standard aka ERC1155.
- EIP-2981 which introduced the NFT Royalty Standard aka ERC2981.
- EIP-3156 which introduced Flash Loans aka ERC3156.
- EIP-712 which introduced Ethereum typed structured data hashing and signing (still in review but is already implemented by the most wallets ).
A complete list can be found at eips.ethereum.org.
