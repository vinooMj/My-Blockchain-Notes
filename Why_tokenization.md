Why tokenization matters by BNY Mellon
 
Tokenization‚Äôs importance stretches far beyond investment access; it could also facilitate new investing models. Currently, most investments leverage shareholder
capitalism, striving to optimize profits and share price.8 For example, when you buy a company‚Äôs stock, you provide money in exchange for a share, but how the company 
is run and governed is largely outside of your direct control.

Since tokenization leverages smart contracts, it could manage both the financial investment as well as facilitate the voting and/or ownership rights associated with 
the investment. There is a possibility of incorporating a stakeholder capitalism model,9 a popular management theory in the 1950s and ‚Äò60s that promoted benefits
provided to the wider community, not just shareholders.10

With tokenization, is it possible to invest in a company but insist that the CEO be paid no more than 100x the median employee compensation or you automatically 
reclaim your original investment? (Currently, in the United States, the average is 274x that of the median employee.11) Or could one invest in cutting-edge 
technology‚Äîcomputer vision, for example ‚Äîand make the investment contingent on the fact that the owner could never sell the intellectual property 
to a company in the defense industry?

Beyond this, with tokenization, the transactions of digitally native assets are stored and listed on a digital ledger on a blockchain network giving one golden 
standard of truth across the globe. Further, the process of leveraging smart contracts permanently records transactions and makes them immutable and instantly
executed.12 This not only provides speed in transactions but also reduces administrative work as there are fewer intermediaries, lowering costs.

What on earth is Tokenization?

So long story short‚Ä¶keeping it as simple as possible for we know how dumb you guys are toh what basically a token is?

The word Tokenization makes it sound a bit complicated so let's replace it with "SUBSTITUTION" to begin with. Assume you are playing a Cricket match and you are the 12th man. If one player gets injured then he/she is replaced by the backup player. This is what is known as substitution, or we can even call it Tokenization.

This concept is being applied greatly in today's world at a number of places primarily in finance.

Finance is one industry which has to be most secure and scam proofthis is where the concept of Tokenization kicks in.

The Reserve Bank Of India has been very vocal on this. On 30th September 2022, RBI adopted Tokenization and aimed to use it as a replacement of Card Details we enter to purchase things over the internet with an alternate code called TOKEN. Now that we know RBI is Pro Tokenization, let's actually understand what makes it this useful.

Continuing with the RBI's plans of Tokenization, if there was a cyber attack and the hackers got hold of the senders and receivers bank account details  then in this case, the sensitive information will remain safe af..only the token will be compromised and that contains a proxy only of the original data.

We have heard how Tokenization and Blockchain goes hand in hand, bole toh bhai-bhai ü§åüèª When it comes to blockchain, Tokenization is the process of converting an asset or the ownership rights of an asset to a unique unit called Token..it's like a unit used to indicate ownership.

It is used extensively in NFTs as well. When we purchase them, we are rewarded royalty in the form of Tokens only and we can trade them for real money as well.

Tokenization is that neighbour who faces a lot of criticism at present however we all know deep down there "ye banda keh toh sahi raha hai" and trust me our lives are incomplete without these neighbours..Tokenization is that inevitable change that is gonna come sooner or later and transform things for real.
