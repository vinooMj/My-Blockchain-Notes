Why tokenization matters by BNY Mellon
 
Tokenization’s importance stretches far beyond investment access; it could also facilitate new investing models. Currently, most investments leverage shareholder
capitalism, striving to optimize profits and share price.8 For example, when you buy a company’s stock, you provide money in exchange for a share, but how the company 
is run and governed is largely outside of your direct control.

Since tokenization leverages smart contracts, it could manage both the financial investment as well as facilitate the voting and/or ownership rights associated with 
the investment. There is a possibility of incorporating a stakeholder capitalism model,9 a popular management theory in the 1950s and ‘60s that promoted benefits
provided to the wider community, not just shareholders.10

With tokenization, is it possible to invest in a company but insist that the CEO be paid no more than 100x the median employee compensation or you automatically 
reclaim your original investment? (Currently, in the United States, the average is 274x that of the median employee.11) Or could one invest in cutting-edge 
technology—computer vision, for example —and make the investment contingent on the fact that the owner could never sell the intellectual property 
to a company in the defense industry?

Beyond this, with tokenization, the transactions of digitally native assets are stored and listed on a digital ledger on a blockchain network giving one golden 
standard of truth across the globe. Further, the process of leveraging smart contracts permanently records transactions and makes them immutable and instantly
executed.12 This not only provides speed in transactions but also reduces administrative work as there are fewer intermediaries, lowering costs.
