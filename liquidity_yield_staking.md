LIQUIDITY MINING VS YIELD FARMING VS STAKING

Liquidity mining is referred to the process of lending crypto assets to a pool in return for some rewards. It is a form of Yield farming but differs in terms of rewards.
Whenever a person provides liquidity to a pool, the platform incentivizes him with some amount of the native tokens of the blockchain on which the platform has been 
built, along with some governance tokens proportional to the liquidity they provided to give them voting rights over any legislature.

Yield farming is the process of lending crypto assets in return for a cut in transaction fees on top of the interest they earn on their provided liquidity. 
Yield farmers usually switch platforms and chains quite frequently in order to generate maximum yield.

Staking is the process of locking your assets on a platform in return for APY. It's used as a method of validation for a lot of cryptocurrencies and hence is 
available extensively. The minimum staking amount is also quite less (approx 1$).

All these terms are quite similar and interchangeably used, but the core difference lies in the rewards and the protocols.
