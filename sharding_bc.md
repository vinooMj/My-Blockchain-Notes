What is Sharding?

Sharding is a technique used to improve the scalability and performance of the network by dividing the database of transactions into smaller, more manageable parts called "shards." Each shard is a separate,
self-contained piece of the database that can be stored on its own node or group of nodes. This allows for better performance and scalability, as well as easier 
management of the data.

In a blockchain network, each node maintains a copy of the entire database of transactions. As the number of transactions increases, the size of the database also 
increases, which can lead to a decrease in performance and scalability. Sharding addresses this problem by dividing the database of transactions into smaller parts,
called shards.

Each shard contains a subset of the transactions, and each shard is responsible for a specific range of transactions. For example, a shard might be responsible for 
all transactions related to a specific asset, or all transactions related to a specific smart contract. This allows for more efficient data retrieval and management, 
as well as the ability to handle a larger amount of data.

When a client requests data from the blockchain, the request is routed to the appropriate shard based on a specific key, such as a transaction hash or an asset ID. 
This key is used to determine which shard contains the requested data, and the request is sent to that shard for processing.

Sharding also allows for improved security, as it makes it more difficult for a malicious actor to take control of a significant portion of the network, as they would 
need to control a significant portion of the shards.

However, implementing sharding in a blockchain network is not a simple task and requires a lot of research and development. There are several different approaches to 
sharding a blockchain network and each approach has its own set of trade-offs. Additionally, it can be challenging to maintain consistency across all the shards, as 
well as managing the communication between the shards.

Overall, sharding is an important technique that has the potential to improve the scalability and performance of blockchain networks, but it does come with its own 
set of challenges that need to be addressed.
