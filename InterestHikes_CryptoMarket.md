INTEREST HIKES vs CRYPTO MARKETS

The central bank of a country decides the interest rate that commercial banks pay for borrowing funds from each other or from the central bank itself.

eg: In India, RBI decides the 'repo rate'. In the US, Federal Reserve decides the 'federal funds rate'.

As the cost of borrowing funds increases for commercial banks, they further increase the interest rate on loans taken by their customers.

Thus, it becomes more difficult to take loans for buying a house, car, education etc. Hence, reducing the money circulating in the economy.

In short, the interest rate hike by central banks is mainly aimed for combating inflation.

But it also impacts the markets!! How?

There are two types of assets:

1) Risk-on assets - like stocks, crypto etc.
2) Risk-off assets - like gold, government bonds etc.

When there's less money circulating in the economy, it leads to lesser allocation towards risk-on assets like stocks and crypto.

Although, it is not the only factor affecting the markets.

Especially, the crypto prices can be moved by something as petty as an Elon Musk's tweet or some Latin American politician's comments.
