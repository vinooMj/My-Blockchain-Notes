These bonds, which issued and traded on blockchain platforms, offer faster settlement cycles, increased transparency, and improved security.

The city of Lugano in Switzerland has issued a CHF100m ($103m) bond on the blockchain-based SIX Digital Exchange (SDX), making it the first municipality to issue a
digital bond. The bond has a maturity of 2029, and can be held in both SDX and SIX (SIX SIS).

ABN AMRO Bank N.V., one of the largest banks in the Netherlands, has issued a digital bond on a public blockchain for the first time in the Netherlands. The bond, 
which raised €450,000, was issued on behalf of aircraft part-out company APOC, one of the bank's commercial clients. The digital bond tokens were considered security 
tokens, which are digital assets that comply with securities regulations and were issued under EU Regulation.

𝗛𝗼𝘄 𝗶𝘁 𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸𝘀?
The issuing entity creates a smart contract on a blockchain platform, which outlines the terms of the bond, such as the interest rate (Coupon), maturity date, and other
details. Investors can then purchase the bond using digital payment tokens, such as cryptocurrency, stable coins or CBDC, and hold the bond on the blockchain as a digital asset. The bond can be traded on a secondary market, allowing investors to buy and sell the bond before maturity.

𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗮𝗱𝘃𝗮𝗻𝘁𝗮𝗴𝗲𝘀 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗾𝘂𝗶𝘁𝗲 𝗰𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿:

✔𝗜𝗻𝗰𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘀𝗲𝗱 𝗮𝗰𝗰𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆 - Digital bonds can be traded on digital platforms 24/7, making them accessible to a wider range of investors.

✔𝗟𝗼𝘄𝗲𝗿 𝗰𝗼𝘀𝘁𝘀 - The digitization of the bond market can reduce costs associated with issuing and trading bonds, making them more attractive to issuers and investors.

✔𝗜𝗻𝗰𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘀𝗲𝗱 𝗲𝗳𝗳𝗶𝗰𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝘆 - Digital bonds can be settled immediately (T+0), saving the need for collaterals and reducing the time and costs associated with the bond market.

#ProjectEden, a joint POC of Tel Aviv Stock Exchange and Israel Ministry of Finance, for issuing digital government bonds on a new DLT platform, is entering its last
phase.
The POC includes digitalization of a new series of bonds and its issuance to the system participants - leading banks (Primary Dealers), international and local.

We expect the project will mark the way for trading and clearing of government bonds on a digital exchange, hence reduce costs, shorten the duration of issuance,
improve transparency, streamline processes and mitigate risks.
