Tokens:

Tokenization
Is the process of creating a digital representation of tangible (real estate, gold) or intangible (cryptocurrencies, carbon credits) assets on a blockchain.

The tokenization of assets opens many possibilities such as fractional ownership. For example, a real estate worth one million USD can be digitally represented in one million tokens so each token is $1.

This lowers the minimum capital requirements for many expensive asset classes such as art, collectibles and allows a crowdfunding style of investment making illiquid assets liquid.

Also, the change of ownership is settled nearly instantly and cheap compared to traditional means, and transparency of ownership is high as every transaction is saved immutable on the blockchain protocol.
