What is Ripple?
Ripple is a blockchain network or a protocol that is used for digital payments for financial transactions. The protocol’s main aim is to create a payment 
settlement asset exchange and remittance system that will be similar to the SWIFT system for international money and security transfers. 
In addition to this, the system will be used by banks and financial middlemen dealing across currencies.

The native token of this blockchain network is XRP. The primary aim of the XRP token is to serve as an intermediate mechanism of exchange between 
two currencies or networks — as a sort of temporary settlement layer denomination.

How Does It Work?
Ripple network does not run on the Proof of Work or Proof of Stake consensus mechanism. However, it has its own unique consensus mechanism to validate 
transactions in which participating nodes verify the authenticity of a transaction by conducting a poll.
To understand the working of the Ripple blockchain let’s take an example of a hawala network. This network is an informal medium of transferring money, 
usually across borders, without any physical money actually moving. For example, if A wants to send $200 to B, who is living in another country. 
A will send $200 to C with a password, which is the local agent of A. Then C will give this money to the local agent of B, that is D with that password. 
However, if the passwords match then D will send that money to B successfully.
Thus, the working of the Ripple blockchain is somewhat like this. It uses a gateway or a link in the trust chain between two parties wanting 
to make a transaction. This gateway acts as a medium between two parties that receives and sends currencies to the public addresses on the Ripple network.

However, it takes only 4 to 5 seconds to complete a transaction as compared to other blockchain networks.
