Static and Dynamic Analysis¶
MythX
Mythril - The Swiss army knife for smart contract security.
Slither - Static analysis framework with detectors for many common Solidity issues. It has taint and value tracking capabilities and is written in Python.
Contract-Library - Decompiler and security analysis tool for all deployed contracts.
Echidna - The only available fuzzer for Ethereum software. Uses property testing to generate malicious inputs that break smart contracts.
Manticore - Dynamic binary analysis tool with EVM support.
Oyente - Analyze Ethereum code to find common vulnerabilities, based on this paper.
Securify - Fully automated online static analyzer for smart contracts, providing a security report based on vulnerability patterns.
SmartCheck - Static analysis of Solidity source code for security vulnerabilities and best practices.
Octopus - Security Analysis tool for Blockchain Smart Contracts with support of EVM and (e)WASM.
sFuzz - Efficient fuzzer inspired from AFL to find common vulnerabilities.
Vertigo - Mutation Testing for Ethereum Smart Contracts.
Weakness OSSClassifcation & Test Cases¶
SWC-registry - SWC definitions and a large repository of crafted and real-world samples of vulnerable smart contracts.
SWC Pages - The SWC-registry repo published on Github Pages
Test Coverage¶
solidity-coverage - Code coverage for Solidity testing.
Linters and Formatters¶
Linters improve code quality by enforcing rules for style and composition, making code easier to read and review.

Ethlint - Yet another Solidity linting.
Solhint - A linter for Solidity that provides both Security and Style Guide validations.
Prettier + Solidity Plugin - Prettier enforces basic style conventions in your code.
