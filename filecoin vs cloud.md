Filecoin is 4000x cheaper than AWS S3.

It’s got about 18 exabytes of #cloud storage capacity.

That’s 1% of the entire global data center storage capacity.

When you store your data using Filecoin’s network, here’s what you get:
 
- No single entity controls your data (until AWS)
- Multiple copies can be stored across different storage providers, thus giving you as many replications (redundancy) as you need.
 
Filecoin achieved all this in 2years after mainnet launch.
