For those that stay building: We need to build better token economies.

This is one tool I've build for myself and that I want to share with everyone.

In every founder conversation I always come back to these fundamental principles of a token economy:

🕸️ You need to solve a coordination problem
🪙 You need utility and constant demand drivers
📈 Your token needs to accrue value
⚒️ You're rewards need to flow to value creating users not just participants
🚛 You need to distribute your tokens through the right distribution methods
🏦 You need sustainability in the way you pay and manage rewards
🌋 Your supply needs to adapt
