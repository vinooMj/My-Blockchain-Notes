Vitalik dropped a HUGE Ethereum roadmap update at EthCC

He outlined the next 3 steps to where the protocol is headed

Here is a quick summary of what’s in store for Ethereum: 🧵👇

1. The Merge
2. The Surge
3. The Verge

High level goal: make Ethereum more accessible to more people (not just devs), light enough for anyone to run, make it less complex over time, 
protect against future threats

Vitalik says he wants the Ethereum network to eventually ‘settle down’, let the other layers on top (L2s) do their job, and finally give the 
devs a break (they’re volunteers, they deserve it!)

The steps are focused on short term, painful implementations that enable long term gains for the ecosystem

Here’s what each step means:

1. The Merge

▪️ This upgrades infrastructure efficiency and network governance

▪️ Everyone knows the next big phase of Ethereum is the Merge

▪️ The Merge is the migration from POW to POS

2. The Surge

▪️ This introduces Sharding

▪️ Sharding = splitting the network into multiple pieces called ‘shards’

▪️ Sharding enables global scale capabilities for the network

3. The Verge

▪️ This switches the network over to Verkle Trees

▪️ Verkle trees = store more state data in a node, allowing for smaller proofs to verify that X included on chain

▪️ Smaller = faster + less memory disk and I/O usage on HW

▪️ Here, the masses can easily stake Ethereum

This roadmap update is big, and gives us a glimpse into the future of what web3 looks like on the backend
