DAOs and decisions

Which are the most pressing issues talked about in DAO forums? 

For me it's always fun to browse through governance forums of various DAOs to see what they're talking about, and 2022 so far has been dominated by 
3 things:

1. Treasury management 
2. Protocol evolution
3. Voting and governance

It's no secret that governance in most DAOs is kinda hacked. The concept of one token one vote though seems fair, in practice it really isn't. 

Imagine there are 10 individuals in the DAO, and one of them owns 90% of all publicly released tokens. Would you call it fair? 

Autonolas published a great research piece on Twitter recently where they analyzed over 1,200 proposals, and tried to figure the key issues, and 
voter participation on issues across 52 DAOs studied by them

According to data, the average participation rate was 0.64% of the community voting per proposal! However, the good new is this is much higher 
for the bigger DAOs with projects like Gitcoin, Balancer, BitDAO recording higher than average community participation rates
