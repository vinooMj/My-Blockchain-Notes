ZK rollups (Zero-Knowledge rollups) are a Layer-2 scaling solution for blockchain networks that allow for increased throughput and reduced transaction costs.
One of the key components of ZK rollups is cryptographic proofs.

In a ZK rollup, transactions are batched together off-chain and submitted to the main chain as a single transaction. This reduces the load on the main chain and 
makes transactions faster and cheaper. However, to ensure the integrity of the off-chain transactions, cryptographic proofs are used.

The cryptographic proofs used in ZK rollups are zero-knowledge proofs, which allow one party (the prover) to prove to another party (the verifier) that a certain
statement is true without revealing any additional information. In ZK rollups, the prover is the off-chain batch of transactions and the verifier is the main chain. 
The zero-knowledge proof is used to prove that the batch of transactions is valid without revealing any of the individual transaction details.

There are several types of zero-knowledge proofs used in ZK rollups, including zk-SNARKs (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge)
and zk-STARKs (Zero-Knowledge Scalable Transparent Argument of Knowledge). These cryptographic proofs are complex and computationally intensive, but they are essential 
for ensuring the security and integrity of ZK rollups.
