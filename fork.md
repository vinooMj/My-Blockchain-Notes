What the FORK:

When Ethereum completed the Merge, it also gave birth to another network called EthereumPoW.
This was the result of a process called 'Forking'.

#Forking is the process by which a #blockchain is split into two different chains. They are forked when their community wants to make a technical 
upgrade to the chain.

As usually happens with any software update, there are some people who love the change, and there are others who are radically opposed to it.

As a peaceful solution to the two opposing factions of the community, the chain splits into 2 different versions that run parallelly:

1. One with the software #upgrade
2. The other without the software upgrade.

This allows people to choose whichever chain rules (software version) they agree with.

Forking can be done in 2 different ways:
i) Hard Fork
ii) Soft Fork

i) Hard Fork happens when the #upgrade is so big that the old rules will not be accepted by the new #version of the chain.

- Think of it like when you change the OS of your phone/laptop. 

If you switch from a #Windows to a #Mac , the windows keyboard shortcuts will no longer work.
#Miners and #nodes on the network have to completely overhaul their #software when a hard fork happens.

Users often have to make a choice on which version they want to use.

The #ETHPoW fork was the result of a certain number of miners saying they won't upgrade to the #POS network during the #Merge

Similarly, Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold etc. evolved out of hard forking the original #Bitcoin Network.

ii) The other method of forking, called Soft Fork, is like a software update within the same OS.

It's like going from Windows 10 to Windows 11.
The previous #keyboard shortcuts are still valid in the new version.

While a soft fork could mean a split into 2 chains too, more often than not, it results in a single chain.

This is because most nodes usually agree unanimously on the software update during the soft fork.

What are forks in blockchain?

The decentralized nature of public blockchains (for example, Bitcoin and Ethereum) means that participants on the network must be able to come to an agreement as to the shared state of the blockchain(shared public ledger and blocks and the blockchain protocol). Unanimous consensus amongst the network nodes results in a single blockchain that contains verified data(transactions) that the network asserts to be correct. However, many times, the nodes in the network can’t come in unanimous consensus regarding the future state of the blockchain. This event leads to forks (like a tuning fork used in experimental science), meaning that point in which the ideal ‘single’ chain of blocks is split into two or more chains which are all valid.

This gives rise to three types of forks which can occur based on the backwards-compatibility of the blockchain protocol and the time
instant at which a new block is mined. These types are as follows :
-Soft Fork: when the blockchain protocol is altered in a backwards-compatible way
-Hard Fork: when the blockchain protocol is altered in a non backwards-compatible way
-Temporary Fork: when two miners mine a new block at the same time

Causes for Blockchain fork :
- Add new functionality
- Fix security issues
- Reverse transactions.

Hard or Soft fork?

Soft forks - everyone is happy
-A soft fork is a software upgrade that can still work with older versions
-A soft fork may be caused by changes that tighten the rules of block validation or implement additional functionality without affecting the network structure
-A soft fork is possible only if a majority of users choose to upgrade to the new version to enforce new rules on the whole blockchain
-Since soft forks do not carry the double-spend risk, they are mostly dull events that go unnoticed by the crypto investment community most of the times
Eg: Block Size Limit, Pay to Script Hash

Hard forks - this is war
-A hard fork implies a change to a software protocol that makes older and newer versions incompatible
-A hard fork is needed to modify structurally essential parameters or loosen the rules of block validation
-Hard forks can be either planned or controversial
-Hard forks are potentially messy and plagued by double spending problem: coins spent in a new block can be spent once again in an old block as merchants and users with the old version of the software will not see the spending registered on a new chain.
Eg: Ethereum’s Byzantium,Monero,Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum classic.

In Conclusion,The whole world of technology keeps evolving with time, and blockchains are keeping up with gusto. However, this does imply a need for continuous upgradation in blockchains. Blockchain forks keep blockchains transforming into newer, more secure, and advanced versions of themselves and also birth new cryptocurrencies. It’s pretty clear why they are integral in the growth of the general crypto ecosystem.
