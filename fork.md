What the FORK:

When Ethereum completed the Merge, it also gave birth to another network called EthereumPoW.
This was the result of a process called 'Forking'.

#Forking is the process by which a #blockchain is split into two different chains. They are forked when their community wants to make a technical 
upgrade to the chain.

As usually happens with any software update, there are some people who love the change, and there are others who are radically opposed to it.

As a peaceful solution to the two opposing factions of the community, the chain splits into 2 different versions that run parallelly:

1. One with the software #upgrade
2. The other without the software upgrade.

This allows people to choose whichever chain rules (software version) they agree with.

Forking can be done in 2 different ways:
i) Hard Fork
ii) Soft Fork

i) Hard Fork happens when the #upgrade is so big that the old rules will not be accepted by the new #version of the chain.

- Think of it like when you change the OS of your phone/laptop. 

If you switch from a #Windows to a #Mac , the windows keyboard shortcuts will no longer work.
#Miners and #nodes on the network have to completely overhaul their #software when a hard fork happens.

Users often have to make a choice on which version they want to use.

The #ETHPoW fork was the result of a certain number of miners saying they won't upgrade to the #POS network during the #Merge

Similarly, Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold etc. evolved out of hard forking the original #Bitcoin Network.

ii) The other method of forking, called Soft Fork, is like a software update within the same OS.

It's like going from Windows 10 to Windows 11.
The previous #keyboard shortcuts are still valid in the new version.

While a soft fork could mean a split into 2 chains too, more often than not, it results in a single chain.

This is because most nodes usually agree unanimously on the software update during the soft fork.
