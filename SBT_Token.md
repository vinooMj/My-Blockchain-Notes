A glance at the Soulbound Tokens (SBT):

Soulbound Token or #SBT are non-transferable, publicly-verifiable #digital #tokens.

Originally taken from the idea of gaming wherein you are issued tokens to be used in the game which can not be transferred or traded. 
Think of SBTs like the non-transferable NFT on Ethereum. A few use-cases of SBT:

- Your University degrees that are issued by your University could be an SBT wherein once you have got your token, you would not be able to transfer 
- it to anyone. 

- It works on POAP (Proof Of Attendance Protocol). For example, companies can hire you based on any conference that you have attended. 
- Your SBT can be a proof of that

- Property Ownership and Renting the property could be enabled by the usage of SBTs. 
- One feature of SBTs is that the issuer can revoke access to the SBT anytime. 

- Your Credit Scores and the Loans that we might incur in the future can be in the form of an SBT that will be revoked as soon as you have paid the loan.

Vitalik(Ethereum Co-Founder) states that SBTs are going to hit the road by the end of 2022 and become mainstream by 2024. 

Key characeteristics:
▪️ Store inmutable records
▪️ Permanently bound to a wallet/account for the entire lifespan
▪️ Shows an individual’s memberships and credentials (e.g. educational)
▪️ Non-tradable and non-transferable
▪️ Unique

Similarly to #NFTs they are non-fungible, but they are non-transferable. #SBTs are can't be traded on any open market or tranferred from one wallet to another.

𝐖𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐚𝐫𝐞 "𝐒𝐨𝐮𝐥𝐬"?
#Souls are #wallets or accounts that host #soulbound tokens enabling instead of money-based frameworks:

▪️ Integrity
▪️ Trust
▪️ Credibility
▪️ Affiliations
▪️ Reputation
▪️ Provenance
▪️ Individual CV

The biggest potential of this concept is when a "Soul" is able to issue SBTs to another "Soul", e.g. a company could operate like a "Soul" issuing SBTs to their shareholders or employees endorsing a person after a successful buiness.

"Souls" can issue self-certified SBTs to themselves. However,the biggest impact is when other "Souls" issue an SBT to another "Soul's" address. The SBT, its issuer, and "Soul's" address can be publicly verified on the #blockchain and therefore easily track or prove the trust circles of a individual "Soul".

Soulbound tokens could bridge the trust gap in #web3. Their non-transferability enables them build social IDs that allow protocols and individuals to function based on trust while maintaining privacy at the same time unlocking benefits that can transform how we view social IDs in real life, e. g. SBTs following the NFT concept can serve as a way for people to prove who they are and confirm their reputation instead of a centralised authority.

For businesses they can observe the immutable history of people before doing business with them, confirming the experience of a candidate before employing them or before leasing a property to them.

𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐬:
▪️ Help in employing the right candidate for a job
▪️ Improving voting mechanisms in #DAOs
▪️ Improving #DeFi lending platforms to issue uncollateralised loans
▪️ Trust relationship in web3 environments

𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐬:
▪️ Revealing too much sensitive information about a person
▪️ Losing "Souls" or SBTs, meaning losing the wallet

𝐁𝐨𝐭𝐭𝐨𝐦 𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐞:
SBTs and "Souls" are an impresive concept of trust within stakeholder in Web3 but there is still a long way to go to solve challenges like losing the private keys and to determine who are the authorities to issue these type of token
