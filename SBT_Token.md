A glance at the Soulbound Tokens (SBT):

Originally taken from the idea of gaming wherein you are issued tokens to be used in the game which can not be transferred or traded. 
Think of SBTs like the non-transferable NFT on Ethereum. A few use-cases of SBT:

- Your University degrees that are issued by your University could be an SBT wherein once you have got your token, you would not be able to transfer 
- it to anyone. 

- It works on POAP (Proof Of Attendance Protocol). For example, companies can hire you based on any conference that you have attended. 
- Your SBT can be a proof of that

- Property Ownership and Renting the property could be enabled by the usage of SBTs. 
- One feature of SBTs is that the issuer can revoke access to the SBT anytime. 

- Your Credit Scores and the Loans that we might incur in the future can be in the form of an SBT that will be revoked as soon as you have paid the loan.

Vitalik(Ethereum Co-Founder) states that SBTs are going to hit the road by the end of 2022 and become mainstream by 2024.
