How to run a validator node on Shardeum in 5 simple steps?

With over 2500 nodes already run on Shardeum, it's time for you to run your own node & be an early supporter of the network.

Step 1: Get a VPS

VPS is an easy way to get started if your system is not compatible to run a node.

Sign up using the this link: https://lnkd.in/dc_BVcpn

Go to Products & Services -> Virtual Private Servers -> Get Palladium 8 GB RAM or a server more powerful than that.

While getting a VPS, make sure you select the operating system as Ubuntu 22.04.

Once you have rented the server, you can find all the details like your rented IP, password, username etc on the dashboard.

Step 2: Connect VPS through SSH

For Windows: Download PuTTY & Install

Launch PuTTY & paste the IP address of VPS that you rented.

A terminal will open, log in using "root" as default user & enter the password from PQ Hosting's VPS dashboard.

For Mac: Use terminal

Press command + space & search for "terminal" & launch it.

Enter "ssh root@YOUR_VPS_IP_HERE" & press enter.

Now enter the password you got from VPS dashboard to get into the Ubuntu client.

Step 3: Follow the docs!

Now that you have a VPS & you're ready with terminal, it's time to get into Shardeum docs & replicate the Linux based process on your terminal.

You can also follow this pastebin to simplify things up instead of the Shardeum docs but always refer back to docs in case you're stuck somewhere.

Step 4: Launch your Node GUI

To launch your node GUI, open your browser & enter https://YOUR-VPS-IP-Address:8080

Enter your password that you used when setting up the dashboard.

Step 5: Stake & start your node

The last step & the most important step is to stake your 10 SHM.

Go to maintenance -> connect wallet -> add stake

Stake 10 SHM & start your node

YOU ARE READY TO GO!
