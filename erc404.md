"WTF is ERC404 ?"

It's a new experimental standard mixing ERC20 & ERC721

ERC20 = fungible tokens like BTC, ETH, SOL...

ERC721 = NFTs like BAYC, Crypto Punks...

"ðŸ˜³ But wait how can a token be both fungible and non fungible? "

That's where ERC404 does its magic ðŸª„: 

if you hold 1 (or more) ERC404, you'll have ERC721 + ERC20

if you hold less than 1 ERC404, you'll only have ERC20

In other words...

Every ERC404 unit = ERC721 (NFT)

Every unit fraction of ERC404 = ERC20 (fongible token)

ERC404 introduces a new approach to NFT fractionalization.
