 (2) Issuance & Emission of BNB

Token issuance is the creation and distribution of tokens as part of a specific event or offering e.g. airdrop, ICO, reverse ICO, IEO, IDO, DAICO, ETO, STO, and SAFT. 
Token emission is the ongoing process of creating and releasing new tokens into circulation e.g. through mining or staking.

BNB is a deflationary token with a non-programmatic burn and a maximum supply of 200 million.

Binance Coin (BNB) was issued as part of Binance's initial coin offering (ICO). Binance pre-mined 200 million BNB. 

The distribution process was:

1. Founders received 80 million BNB vested over 4 years.

2. Investors received 20 million BNB with no vesting or lock-up restrictions.

Binance regularly burns BNB and plans to continue this till 100 million BNB are burned.
