𝐄𝐑𝐂-𝟒𝟗𝟎𝟕: 𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐞𝐬 𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐨 𝐩𝐥𝐚𝐲

To the list of 30 existing NFT standards on the Ethereum blockchain we now have to add ERC-4907.

This new standard allows users to lend and borrow non-fungible tokens from others for a set period of time.

This means:
1. Owner = owns.
2. User = can have the NFT but no transferability.

In addition, one of the advantages of this standard over others is that it optimizes network gas costs by automating the expiration of usage permissions
for NFTs. This eliminates the need for holders to make a second transaction to claim ownership rights as is the case in some current NFT leasing schemes.

Some use cases that come to mind are:
1. In game rental (#P2E #Metaverse)
2. Property Rental
3. Music Streaming
4. Equipment Rental

It can definitely be a game-changing standard.
