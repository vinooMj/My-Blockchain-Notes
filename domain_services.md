NFT Domains

I’m sure by now you have heard of Ethereum Name Service (ENS), Unstoppable Domains or maybe, Bonfida (Solana Domain Names)

☝🏼 These are NFT domain names providers.

NFT domain names help reduce the hassle of using cryptocurrencies.

How⁉️

💡These domains allow their users to create human-readable URLs to replace complicated and long wallet addresses.

This way, when someone wants to send crypto, they can send it to an address easy to remember 🤓

For instance, if you want to send me crypto to my Solana wallet:


• Instead of typing this

ASVQHMKEqwesfy4v3Ex6uVH4rUGwcYFsvm6dZhMnZq9g 😵‍💫

• You simply type this

Josesanchez.sol ⭐️


💡 This lowers the risk of error significantly.

Another key feature is that they allow you to create websites that are:

✅ Censorship-resistant

✅ Decentralized and,

✅ 100% private

You can upload your website onto the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) using your NFT domain name 🚀

What are the differences between ENS, Unstoppable Domains and Bonfida ❓

- ENS requires renewal fees.

- Unstoppable and Bonfida allow you to keep your domain forever.

- ENS domains always end with .ETH

- Unstoppable domains could end in .blockchain, .crypto, .x, .bitcoin, .dao, .nft and many more.

- Bonfida domains end with .SOL

- By owning an ENS you can be part of their DAO.

- Unstoppable Domains allow you to purchase them with fiat currency.

- Bonfida domains are the most affordable ones and have low transaction fees.

- Bonfida allows you to turn your Twitter handle into an NFT domain 💫

Which should you get❓

The one you like, that you can get and that you can afford.

Yes, right now NFT domains are hot and they are becoming expensive by the day 🔥

On the other hand, ENS are less expensive than Unstoppable but, many names are already taken so you would have to buy them at a 
higher price in a secondary market plus, don’t forget gas fees ⛽️

If you like emojis for domain names, Bonfida allows more freedom of characters and gas fees are insignificant. Nonetheless, the shorter n
ames are more costly.

For example, this domain in the picture bellow (🙋🏻‍♂️.sol) is selling for 500 SOL in Magic Eden, which translates to more than $20,000 USD.
