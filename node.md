Part 1: What is a blockchain node?

Recap: blockchains are simply sets of instructions. Computers implement those instructions. People and companies run those computers to implement those instructions.

Nodes are like servers, they run blockchain networks much like servers run websites.

Nodes are the backbone of blockchain networks, the more nodes, the more resilient and decentralized the blockchain is.

What do nodes do?
- Validate blocks of transactions
- Store copies of the blockchain
- Send information across the network

Components:
- Compute
- Storage (copy of the ledger)
- Software (client of protocol)

Types of nodes:
- Full Nodes: fully validates transactions and blocks, accept transactions and blocks from other full nodes, validate those transactions
- and blocks, relaying them to other full nodes.

- Light Nodes: software that connects to full nodes, don't have to run 24/7 or read/ write blockchain data. Only store a handful of
- most recent blocks and do not archive.

- Super Nodes: scales node functionality, maintains data correctness.
