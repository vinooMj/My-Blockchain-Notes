Querying blockchain data has always been a challenge, primarily because blockchain doesn’t store data in traditional database formats like tables or collections. In enterprise blockchain environments, data is often stored in reference to a key, making it easy to retrieve specific data but difficult to perform complex 
queries like using 'Where' conditions. To get around this, offchain databases are typically used, but this introduces risks like stale or incorrect data.
To solve this, Spydra has launched a feature that allows you to run complex queries directly on the blockchain database without needing an offchain solution! 
While this solves a big part of the problem, there’s still a technical barrier to writing these queries.
But today, we’re excited to announce our newest feature—integrating GenAI into our platform. This means users can now query blockchain systems like Hyperledger
Fabric using plain English! Non-technical users, such as product managers and business analysts, can now access and query blockchain data in their natural language, making blockchain data truly accessible.
