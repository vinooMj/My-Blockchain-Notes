NFT Finance is one of the narratives that is getting built at a great pace.[Part 2 - NFT Liquidity]

To keep this organized, the post will be separated into four parts:

🏦| Loans
💧| Liquidity
💹| Derivatives
🏷️| Appraisals

-------💧NFT Liquidity:-------

NFTs are exclusive – that’s the point. Their #scarcity and #uniqueness have been a big reason behind their massive growth. However, the lack of #liquidity 
this creates could start to see NFTs remain within their own unique niche; as opposed to the widespread,

cross-chain adoption of #fungible tokens. And this is a great shame.

#Fractional NFTs (where an NFT is broken down into fractions that can be bought) creates a partial solution. There are a few #developers doing some 
really interesting things within this space however, by splitting an #NFT into smaller parts, you are simply further diluting liquidity for a great
many NFTs and #artists . What’s more, these are still fixed within the NFT ecosystem.

What would truly begin to solve this liquidity, and therefore #scale issue would be the ability to provide cross-chain #integration to the NFT space. 

Here are some projects working on NFT Liquidity 👇

#Sudoswap is paving the way for NFT #financial products. They're a fully on-chain, gas-efficient decentralized NFT marketplace. What makes sudoswap
different is the ability for buyers and sellers to swap into #customizable bonding curves created by liquidity providers.

#AssetMerge is an AMM that facilitates instant selling of any NFT while pricing each NFT uniquely based on its #nonfungible nature and the general 
demand for the collection. Other features include limit orders and flash swaps to #arbitrage NFTs between marketplaces.

#DanuFinance allows P2P #trading for NFTs with an additional liquidity pool aspect like Sudo that sellers can use to get instant liquidity at all times. 
#Traders will also be able to submit specialized buy orders for desirable feature sets.

NFTX® was a pioneer in creating instant liquidity for NFTs. Instant liquidity is achieved by depositing a floor NFT into an NFTx vault which in return 
gives the depositor #ERC20 token that can then be sold on a #decentralized exchange.

#FloorDAO bolsters liquidity for NFTx vaults leading to better rates and less spread. This is accomplished through bonding and protocol-owned liquidity 
which was introduced by #OlympusDAO. They are looking to expand to #sudoswap in the coming months.

#GumBallProtocol is a #launchpad and liquid NFT marketplace for new NFT collections. Users can sell, #swap, and borrow against their NFTs instantly. 
This is made possible by Gumball Tokens which are ERC20s bought from a bonding curve that correspond to an NFT collection.
