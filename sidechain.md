Sidechains can help you avoid expensive mistakes

Would you pay $50 tax and wait in long queues for your $5 Starbucks?

If you've been using Ethereum, that's what every transaction feels like. The high gas prices and the slow transaction rates, quite frankly, suck. If you are like me 
and experiment with 
different apps on Ethereum, it's time to cut down on #expenditure, and switch to using sidechains:

Side-chains are separate chains attached to a main #blockchain through a two-way road.

Imagine there's a toll (A) on a highway that experiences large traffic everyday. To help it out, someone builds another highway with its own toll (B), which 
absorbs some of the traffic. The toll B operates on its own, without any interference from toll A.

However, there's a catch. The toll B only accepts gift cards.

If you decide to go through the new highway, you have to deposit some #money to the old highway, and in exchange you will get gift cards which you can use at toll B.
Once you've crossed the highway, if you wish, you can exchange the remaining balance in gift cards for your original #currency 
.
Now in the above example:

• Main highway = Main blockchain (eg. Ethereum)
• New highway = Sidechain (eg. Polygon Technology)
• Tolls A & B = #Consensus mechanisms of main blockchain and sidechain
• Original Currency = Token of main blockchain (eg. ETH for Ethereum)
• Gift cards = Token of sidechain (eg. MATIC for Polygon)

Sidechains allow you to do exact same transactions as the main blockchain, only much faster and much cheaper, so that you get your $5 coffee without any wait time and
with a mere 50 cent tax.
