What is Web 3.0 ?

Web 3.0, called the semantic web by the World Wide Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee, is the next frontier of web development that will likely be based on AI, IoT and blockchain technology. Web 3.0 will be able to interact directly with users, devices, and systems in smart homes, smart vehicles and workplaces

The diagram below shows Web 1.0/Web 2.0/Web 3.0 from a bird's-eye view by ByteByteGo

✳️ Web 1.0 - Read Only
Between 1991 and 2004, the internet is like a catalog of static pages. We can browse the content by jumping from one hyperlink to another.
It doesn’t provide any interactions with the content.

✳️ Web 2.0 - Read Write
From 2004 to now, the internet has evolved to have search engines, social media apps, and recommendation algorithms backed apps. 
Because the apps digitalize human behaviors and persist user data when users interact with these apps, big companies leverage user data for 
advertisements, which becomes one of the main business models in Web 2.0. 

✳️ Web 3.0 - Read Write Own
The idea has been discussed a lot recently due to the development of blockchain and decentralized apps. The creators’ content is stored on 
IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) and owned by the users. If apps want to access the data, they need to get authorization from the users 
and pay for it.
