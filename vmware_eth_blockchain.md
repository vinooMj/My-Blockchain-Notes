VMware says its permissioned version of Ethereum is unique in four ways. The first relates to privacy, where it uses a combination of zero-knowledge proofs 
and multi-party computation. Recently Bank of Israel deployed a VMware privacy solution as part of its central bank digital currency research. And VMware 
published a related paper on UnTraceable Transactions (UTT) earlier this year.

The second key feature that VMware’s Ethereum solution highlights is scalability. It executes transactions in parallel. Typically parallel execution 
can be problematic because ordering transactions, especially in trading, is often essential. In conventional systems, when a transaction is initiated, 
say to sell a stock, the software might lock the stock until the transaction is completed. Instead, VMware’s approach is optimistic, and lets transactions 
run in parallel. At the end of the processing, it verifies that there are no issues before writing it to the blockchain.
