You can now rent NFTs (aka ERC-4907)

Here‚Äôs how this will change everything üëá 


ERC-20 - basic tokens
ERC-721 - NFTs
ERC-1155 - smart contracts that can manage multiple token types
ERC-4907 - rentable NFTs

Cool, tell me more!
Q: Why should I care?
A: Renting things is a very important function that we all do every day. Think of it like renting someones clothes (rent the runway), renting a car (Hertz), or 
renting someones house (AirBNB). People can rent NFTs the same way - an item in a video game, a pass to a club, art to display, or even a game character to make
money without paying a larger upfront cost.

Q: How does ERC-4907 work?
A: There‚Äôs a few parts involved - the Owner (owns the NFT), the User (holds the NFT in their wallet but can‚Äôt sell or transfer), and the ‚Äúexpires‚Äù function

which enforces an automatic end of a use without needing to do anything else.

This is a super exciting update that will unleash tons of innovation much like NFTs themselves. No longer will you need intermediaries to manage the complications 
of rentals.
