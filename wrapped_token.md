WHAT IS A WRAPPED TOKEN?

A cryptocurrency is native to its own blockchain. It can't be moved to another blockchain. So in order to use it on some other blockchain, 
we need to 'wrap' it.

For example, if we want to use bitcoin on the ethereum blockchain, our bitcoin is locked and another token is minted on the ethereum blockchain which 
represents our bitcoin. This token is called wrapped bitcoin or wBTC. We can then use it on ethereum blockchain, say for trading. Later, 
when we want to redeem our 'original' bitcoin, our wBTC is destroyed and the original bitcoin is unlocked on the Bitcoin blockchain.

We can do it for other cryptocurrencies as well. For example we can represent ether on polygon chain as wrapped ether or wETH.

In fact, we can use wETH on ethereum blockchain as well for trading purposes since wETH complies with a standard called ERC20 which adds certain s
tandard properties to the token for trading etc. The actual ether currency is not currently ERC20 compliant.

To summarise, a wrapped token is a representation of a cryptocurrency on another blockchain or with a specific standard.
