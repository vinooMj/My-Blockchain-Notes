SMART CONTRACT SECURITY VERIFICATION STANDARD !

Smart Contract Security Verification Standard (v1.2) is a checklist created to standardize the security of smart contracts for developers, architects, security 
reviewers and vendors. This list helps to avoid the majority of known security problems and vulnerabilities by providing guidance at every stage of the development 
cycle of the smart contracts (from designing to implementation).

Use cases:
You can use the SCSVS checklist in multiple ways:

1. As a starting point for formal threat modelling exercise.
2. As a measure of your smart contract security and maturity.
3. As a scoping document for penetration test or security audit of a smart contract.
4. As a formal security requirement list for developers or third parties developing the smart contract for you.
5. As a self-check for developers.
