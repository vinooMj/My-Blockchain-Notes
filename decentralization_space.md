The name of the blockchain game is decentralization.

But how many nodes should the network have before we call one "decentralized"?

Is it hundreds? Thousands? Millions?

I don't know the answer. Right now, most chains have something like low thousands of nodes participating in the network:

- Ethereum (~4800)
- Solana (~1800)
- Avalanche (~1300).
- Cardano (~2700)

It's hard to run a node. Networks provide guidance on how good the machine needs to be in order to run the software. And it's not a cakewalk. 
Here's Avalanche's requirements compared to 
the newest Macbook Pro:

- CPU: 8 CPU threads (vs. Macbook 8-core chip)
- RAM: 16 GiB (vs. Macbook 8GB)
- Storage: 1 TB (vs. Macbook 256 GB)
- OS: Ubuntu 18.04/20.04 or MacOS >= Catalina

To meet the minimum, you'd have to spend around $2,000 on a new Macbook with these specs. Not as bad as Solana (which has way higher requirements) 
but also not something you walk right into.

What if we could participate in a blockchain network using just our phones?

We'd unlock the ~6.5 billion smartphone users in the world. 1 million nodes would be .01% of these phones.

Two examples of where this could be possible:

1. Celestia - Celestia is a new blockchain that's specialized in just one step of a blockchain's usual functions. The goal is to scale overall 
performance by only taking care of this step - note that it also means that it's meant to be built on and isn't a fully functioning blockchain itself.

It performs a step that can be done by done on a phone. In fact, we already have examples of this live.

2. Mina - Mina is a super-lightweight blockchain. You'll see above that Avalanche needs 1 TB of storage, mostly because it saves the history of what 
has happened.

Mina uses cryptographic proofs to compact everything into just 22 kilobytes. That makes it accessible to devices like phones.

The huge caveat is that phones only perform limited functionality in both of these networks (and using a phone for Mina is not yet live); we still
need these bigger machines to do the heavier lifting.
