How blockchain can transform AI ðŸ§ 

1/12 As AI algorithms rely on data to learn, infer and make decisions, they work better with data that is reliable, secure, trusted, and credible. Blockchain provides 
a distributed ledger that stores and transacts data in a cryptographically signed, validated, and agreed-upon way.

2/12 By using blockchain, data can be stored with high integrity and resiliency, making it impossible to tamper with. This enhances data security and ensures that the
outcome of AI-driven decisions can be trusted and undisputed.


3/12 The consolidation of AI and blockchain creates a secure, immutable, decentralized system for the highly sensitive information that AI-driven systems must collect,
store and utilize.

4/12 AI can benefit from the availability of many blockchain platforms for executing machine learning algorithms and tracing data stored on decentralized P2P storage
systems. Smart connected products such as IoT devices, swarm robots, smart cities, buildings, and vehicles can be used as sources.

5/12 The features and services of the cloud can also be harnessed for off-chain machine learning analytics, intelligent decision making and data visualization.

6/12 Some of the significant benefits of leveraging blockchain for AI include enhanced data security, improved trust on robotic decisions, collective decision making,
decentralized intelligence, and high efficiency.

7/12 By recording the decision-making process of an AI system on a blockchain, transparency is increased, and public trust is gained to understand the robotic decisions.

8/12 The need for a third-party auditor can be eliminated in a swarm robotic ecosystem where consensus in the swarm can be achieved through an absolutely decentralized
approach.

9/12 In a robotic swarm ecosystem, all the agents need to work in coordination to achieve the swarm goal. Decentralized and distributed decision-making algorithms have
been adopted in many robotic applications without the need for a central authority.

10/12 By combining different individual cybersecurity AI agents to provide fully coordinated security across the underlying networks, decentralized intelligence can be
achieved to take smart high-level decisions involving multiple agents.

11/12 The integration of AI and blockchain technologies enables intelligent Decentralized Autonomous Agents (or DAOs) for automatic and fast validation of 
data/value/asset transfers among different stakeholders.

12/12 In summary, blockchain can transform AI by addressing its shortcomings such as data security, trust in robotic decisions, collective decision making, decentralized intelligence, and high efficiency. This technology can be utilized in various fields, including medical, personal, 
banking and financial, trading, and legal data.
