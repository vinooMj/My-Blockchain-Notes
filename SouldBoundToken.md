Soulbound Tokens or #SBT are non-transferable, non-tradable, publicly-verifiable #digital #tokens.

𝐊𝐞𝐲 𝐜𝐡𝐚𝐫𝐚𝐜𝐞𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐜𝐬:
▪️ Store inmutable records
▪️ Permanently bound to a wallet/account for the entire lifespan
▪️ Shows an individual’s memberships and credentials (e.g. educational)
▪️ Non-tradable
▪️ Non-transferable
▪️ Unique

Similarly to #NFTs they are non-fungible, but they are non-transferable. #SBTs are can't be traded on any open market or tranferred from one wallet to another.

#Souls are #wallets or accounts that host #soulbound tokens instead of money-based frameworks:

▪️ Integrity
▪️ Trust
▪️ Credibility
▪️ Affiliations
▪️ Reputation
▪️ Provenance
▪️ Individual CV

Huge potentials of this concept is when a "Soul" is able to issue SBTs to another "Soul", e.g. a company could operate like a "Soul" issuing SBTs to their
shareholders or employees endorsing a person after a successful buiness.

"Souls" can issue self-certified SBTs to themselves. However,the biggest impact is when other "Souls" issue an SBT to another "Soul's" address. The SBT, its issuer, 
and "Soul's" address can be publicly verified on the #blockchain and therefore easily track or prove the trust circles of a individual "Soul".

Soulbound tokens could bridge the trust gap in #web3. Their non-transferability enables them build social IDs that allow protocols and individuals to function based 
on trust while maintaining privacy at the same time unlocking benefits that can transform how we view social IDs in real life, e. g. SBTs following the NFT concept can serve as a way for people to prove who they are and confirm their reputation instead of a centralised authority.

For 𝐛𝐮𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐞𝐬𝐬𝐞𝐬 they can observe the immutable history of people before doing business with them, confirming the experience of a candidate before employing them or
before leasing a property to them.

▪️ Help in employing the right candidate for a job
▪️ Improving voting mechanisms in #DAOs
▪️ Improving #DeFi lending platforms to issue uncollateralised loans
▪️ Trust relationship in #web3 environments

𝐒𝐨𝐜𝐢𝐚𝐥 𝐑𝐞𝐜𝐨𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐲 𝐌𝐨𝐝𝐞𝐥 via communities of nearby SBT holders users can appoint a set of individuals or institutions as “guardians.”

𝐁𝐨𝐭𝐭𝐨𝐦 𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐞:
We will see if SBTs and "Souls" are the key to unlock the future of a Decentralized Society, surely with implementing concepts as ZK Proof (#ZeroKnowledge Proof)
into SBTs to insure privacy without giving any further information other than the statement itself.
