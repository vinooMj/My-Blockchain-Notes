he Next Disruptive Force:  Decentralized Identity On Chain

The concept of decentralization is a core tenet of Web3 technology. Decentralization provides users with ownership, access and control of their own data without relying
on Big Tech intermediaries.

This concept of decentralization can also be applied to how identity is stored and verified. Instead of relying on third-party servers, users have complete control over
their personal information stored only in their wallets.

 State Of Play
Certificate fraud, fake credentials, slow verification processes, and data breaches are just some of the problems associated with our current centralized digital 
identity systems that decentralized identity technology can solve.

Decentralized identity is a type of identity management that has the following benefits for:
+Organizations: Issuing organizations can provide fraud-proof credentials and verifying organizations can instantly check the authenticity of credentials. 
+Individuals: Fully own and control their digital identity and credentials without relying on any third party to prove their claims.
+Developers: Build user-centric apps that eliminate the need for passwords and inefficient authentication processes.

 A decentralized identity system is made up of 3 pillars:

 Blockchain
 Verifiable Credentials (VCs)
 Decentralized identifiers (DIDs)

Decentralized identity technology can be applied to a growing number of use cases including supply chain traceability, issuing fraud-proof certifications, and managing
employee IDs.

In fact, multiple studies have shown that hacked or leaked personal information is among the most frequently traded products on the dark web.

The way D-ID functions on a blockchain, by contrast, is at once more public and more private. Blockchains are decentralized, immutable ledgers (or databases), allowing 
for individuals to transact peer-to-peer while maintaining consensus concerning the ledger/data, ultimately creating a source of shared truth. Blockchains are public in
the sense that any participant or even outsider can audit every transaction and address, and they’re private in the sense that, unless they’re explicitly permissioned, 

blockchains require no KYC (Know Your Customer) and users can participate anonymously with their blockchain addresses possessing little or no link to their off-chain 
identities.

One especially promising use case for blockchain technology is to improve the D-ID experience by applying the best features of blockchain technology to legacy D-ID
systems. Though the architectural details vary, a blockchain-based D-ID solution would ideally allow users to selectively choose with whom and when they share their
information, keep user information off of databases vulnerable to attack, allow users to better
