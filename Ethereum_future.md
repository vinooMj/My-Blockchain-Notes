ast Forward 10 Years: Vitalik Buterin's Vision for Ethereum ❗

You have a node...

...and that node runs on your phone!

Every 12 seconds, 32 seconds, or whatever interval we settle on.

You download 3.6 Megabytes of data.

- Hash it
- Elliptic curve calculations

Verify a SNARK!

✅ Done! You've confirmed the block is valid.

Wait another 12 seconds, receive 33.6 Megabytes of data, hash it, execute a couple more elliptic curve operations, and verify the SNARK again.

✅ Verified!

And 12 seconds later...

- Data
- Hash
- Elliptic curve check

✅ Validated!

➡ The entire process has become incredibly sleek and seamless to the extent that even a phone can handle it.

Why? Because it demands very little computational power. It mainly relies on data.

Fortunately, data processing is something phones have become impressively efficient at, and they're only expected to improve in the coming decade.

That, in my eyes, is the future of Ethereum in 10 years.
