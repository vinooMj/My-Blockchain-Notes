How to Perform a Smart Contract Audit?

Auditing Smart Contracts involve an in-depth evaluation of the smart contracts of blockchain applications. The underlying methodology of a smart contract audit is 
relatively standard among audit providers. Following are the steps involved in the smart contract audit process.

1- Requirement Gathering
It contributes to determining the audit scope, intended business behaviour, overall architecture, and project’s goal. Auditors must have access to documents such as
the business requirement document, the project’s whitepaper/ yellow paper, technical specification document, smart contract code via GitHub commits, and others.

2- Unit Testing
Here, writing unit test cases is the developer’s job. While, the auditor test runs unit test cases, determining if the smart contract is functioning as planned. At this 
stage, smart contract auditors use auditing tools and testnet, ensuring unit testing covers the maximum risk involved. 

3- Manual Auditing
It is the most crucial aspect of the auditing process. The auditor scans the code line by line for vulnerabilities. Later, the auditor deploys auditing tools such as 
Mythril, slither, mythx, scribble, and others for thorough scrutiny of the code.
Auditors advise smart contract changes based on vulnerabilities and code optimization.

4- Initial Reporting
Following manual and automated audits, an initial report highlighting issues and their severity levels is compiled. Furthermore, the security team provides explanations
for issues with the smart contract and its severity levels.

5- Code Refactoring
At this stage, auditors directly collaborate with project developers, where developers amend the code based on the initial report. Ideally, every bug, irrespective of 
its severity level, must be considered, but the developer should first prioritize resolving high and medium-severity issues.

6- Final Report
Postcode refactoring, auditors once again scan through the smart contract, reverifying for optimal code functionality.
