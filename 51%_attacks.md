51% Attacks

These attacks are more likely to occur in the chainâ€™s early stage, and a 51% attack does not apply to enterprise or private blockchains. 
A 51% attack occurs when a single individual or organization (malicious hackers) collects more than half of the hash rate and seizes control
of the entire system. Hackers can modify the order of #transactions and prevent them from being confirmed. They can even reverse previously
completed transactions, resulting in double-spending.

How can we prevent these attacks?
- Improve mining pool monitoring
- Avoid using PoW consensus procedures
- Make certain that the hash rate is higher
