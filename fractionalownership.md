In general, fractionalownership refers to owning a percentage of a share in an asset, usually a real estate property.

This technique is now utilized widely where businesses and individuals benefit mutually.

An example…

Using #tokenization and fractional #NFTs, real estate properties are now tokenized and converted into NFT fractions.

This way, investors (both small and large) from all over the world will be able to invest in #realestate properties.

Since the properties are #tokenized , it won’t require a huge capital investment.

However, the benefits include income sharing (rent), priority access, reduced rates, and more.
