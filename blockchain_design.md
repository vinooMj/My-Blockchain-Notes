We've analyzed both #monolithic and #modular blockchains, two different approaches to blockchain design. Monolithic blockchains, 
such as #Bitcoin and
#Ethereum, prioritize robust security and high levels of decentralization. Ethereum, for example, has become the leading smart 

contract platform due to its emphasis on these aspects. However, these strengths often come at the expense of scalability, leading to 
high and volatile transaction fees during periods of high demand.

Enter modular blockchains. Emerging as an alternative, modular designs aim to address the scalability challenge by striking a balance 
between scalability, security, and decentralization. These blockchains offer a promising solution, but how do they fare in practice?

As we continue to push the boundaries of digital payments, we believe it's essential to share our research and foster meaningful 
conversations about the future of this tech.
