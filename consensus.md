Consensus Algorithams

POW
The PoW mechanism is highly secure. Bitcoin has been running for 12 years now, and the network has yet to be compromised. This inherent security is well-suited to a financial ledger, which is why so many cryptocurrencies adopt PoW. However, it comes with the significant challenge of being highly inefficient. First of all, the process of solving the hash puzzle takes several minutes. Because Bitcoin has a fixed block size of 1MB, this limits the network to a processing speed of around 4–5 transactions per second, compared to the Visa network which processes an average of 1,700 transactions per second.

Another drawback to this consensus mechanism uses a lot of resources which turns out to be energy-inefficient.

According to Statista, bitcoin’s average energy consumption per transaction (as of August 16, 2021) is 1 722.24 kilowatt-hours, compared to that of 100 000 Visa transactions – 148.63 kWh

POS
In this case, the weight of a participant’s vote is not tied to the scarce resource of computing power, but to the scarce resource of capital.

There is a random mechanism that determines who is allowed to build (“mint”, “forge”, “bake”) and attach the next block. With the help of this mechanism, the probability of being selected is linked to the amount of cryptocurrency that the node has deposited and locked (staked) for this purpose..
 
The deposit also incentivizes the node to stick to the rules of the network, as any misbehaviour detected will lead to the node losing this deposit.
