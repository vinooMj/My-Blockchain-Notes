What is EWASM?

A web assembly (WASM) version implemented by the Ethereum Virtual Machine that provides additional functionality for blockchains. Ethereum WebAssembly is a 
proposed redesign of the Ethereum smart contract execution layer using a deterministic subset of WebAssembly.

The use of WebAssembly as a format for smart contracts gains a variety of benefits, a few of which are listed below:
- Near-native execution speed for smart contracts
- The possibility to develop smart contracts in many traditional programming languages, such as C, C++, and Rust
- Access to a vast developer community and the toolchain surrounding WebAssembly

The Ewasm specification consists of a subset of WebAssembly components suitable for Ethereum needs, namely determinism and relevant features. It also includes a 
number of system smart contracts that provide access to the features of the Ethereum platform.

The advantages of Ewasm are quite explicit: faster execution speed, improved hardware support, superior support for existing tools, language portability, and access 
to the large community of the WebAssembly ecosystem.

The Ewasm project aims for backward compatibility by also supporting the current opcode instruction set and including transcompile options in its specifications, 
beyond allowing new smart contracts to be written in high-level languages like Rust, Go, etc.

The implementation of Ewasm on Ethereum seems to be an imminent reality. The advantages around this technology in creating a highly scalable virtual machine with
programming properties in high-level languages are the perfect recipe to guarantee the sustainability of the blockchain industry under the Web3 scheme.

The move to Ethereum 2 will have vast implications for its scalability, security, decentralization, and economics. Throughputs of around 10,000 transactions per 
second are anticipated, and the abandoning of proof-of-work could improve the decentralization and carbon footprint of the network by greatly reducing the amount 
of computational work that validators must perform.

The eWasm will be a new EVM, which will allow smart contracts to be written in any programming language and not just Solidity, as is currently the case with Ethereum.

The implications behind this are important, as it will allow more developers to write smart contracts in programming languages that they are already familiar with.

The result could be staggering for the industry, increasing the number of developers in dApp in languages other than solidity as well.

In Conclusion,The development of contracts will get broader through Ewasm contracts. It is expected to support multiple languages like C, Rust, C++. It will
also support many prominent JavaScript engines of Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, and Mircosoft Edge. Ewasm is set to make Ethereum as “the world’s computer” 
with better performances and efficiency. It will help scale Ethereum to a new level, which might not have been possible with EVM.
