Web3 - Web3: mainly described as the decentralized web (still a term under construction.) In web3, instead of centralized entities owning and controlling the servers,
       individual contributors provide the infrastructure.
       
Blockchain-  shared and immutable ledger. On the blockchain, the information is distributed among multiple computers that work together to provide the underlying infrastructure.
             A blockchain does not have to be decentralized. I mostly see people take decentralization as a given when they refer to blockchain however, blockchain does not imply decentralization.
             

Cryptocurrencies(crypto)- digital currencies secured by cryptographic functions. Most are based on blockchain technology. Can be coins or tokens. 

                          Coins have their own blockchain(eg: BTC, ETH). Tokens are on existing blockchains.
                          
Smart Contracts- self-executing computer program stored inside the blockchain. When the conditions of a smart contract are met, the code is automatically executed.

Non-Fungible Token (NFT)- unique digital assets on the blockchain. They are each one of a kind; this allows for tracking the ownership.

eb3 does not have to use blockchain technology. In the context of Ethereum, that is the technology used. However, keep in mind that web3 and blockchain are not the same.
